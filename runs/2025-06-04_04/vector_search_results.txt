  Text: I'm building an AI tool to generate SaaS ideas based on your skills – would you use it?   
Hi everyone,  
I’m working on a tool that helps developers and makers like us who want to build something but don’t know *exactly what*.

The idea is simple:  
\- You share your current tech stack, interests, and strengths.  
\- The tool analyzes demand and trends (from Reddit, X, etc.).  
\- It suggests a SaaS idea tailored to your strengths, with a landing page, roadmap, tweet thread ideas, and even a launch plan.

Yes, you can do some of this with ChatGPT, but I’m aiming to centralize everything into one clean flow: no bouncing between tabs, no vague prompts, and no messy docs.

It's currently an MVP, and users can test onboarding + idea discovery.  
If interested, you can [join the waitlist](https://l.messenger.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fv0-idea-clarity-zeta.vercel.app%2Fauth%2Fsignin&h=AT3C_tw-qduLun142yfLHm5-HoGgICvpj7wLlEDY8fzcepYSCIeZ7_cHcZQdG8GJAwe6J74ruTghDey1S7yvCY-C2XTl0zuNf8VeYfYjt0emZ-nXePkerJUM43jvcyaoW_qccQ) for early access.

  Text: Here are 3 startup ideas my tool fished out of Reddit threads Hey Reddit, 
for context: I build a tool that searches through Reddit threads and filters out validated business ideas.
Here are some problems, users posted about, which could be solved by a saas business, which were sorted out by my tool.

1. User seeks a streamlined tool, preferably compatible with Google Drive and potentially beyond Zapier, to automate the repetitive process of creating and structuring client folders with nested subfolders within Google Drive upon onboarding new clients, aiming to eliminate manual setup and improve efficiency.

2. User needs a tool to manage to-do lists organized by projects, allowing them to create a unified dashboard with selected items from various projects and enabling the completion status to synchronize between the dashboard and the individual project lists.

3. A user is seeking strategies to overcome communication barriers experienced by small businesses when dealing with international wholesalers online, specifically regarding language proficiency in English during basic inquiries.


A more detailed version of the posts and problems will be part of the MVP which is coming this week. (Already promised it earlier but faced some technical issues that have to be fixed)

If you have any feedback, let me know!

I’m a final-year B. Tech student in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning, looking to collaborate with a startup, founder, or builder who has a real business problem that could benefit from an AI/ML-based solution. This is for my 6–8 month capstone project, and I’d like to contribute by building something useful from scratch.

I’m offering to contribute my time and skills in return for learning and real-world exposure.

# What I’m Looking For

* A real business process or workflow that could be automated or improved using ML.
* Ideally in healthcare, fintech, devtools, SaaS, operations, or education.
* A project I can scope, build, and ship end-to-end (with your guidance if possible).

# What I Bring

* Built a FAQ automation system using RAG (LangChain + FAISS + Google GenAI) at a California-based startup.
* Developed a medical imaging viewer and segmentation tool at IIT Hyderabad.
* Worked on satellite image-based infrastructure damage detection at IIT Indore.

Other projects:

* Retinal disease classification with Transformers and Multi-Scale Fusion.
* Multimodal idiom detection using image + text data.
* IPL match win prediction using structured data and ML models.

# Why This Might Be Useful

If you have a project idea or an internal pain point that hasn’t been solved due to time or resource constraints, I’d love to help you take a shot at it. I get real experience; you get a working MVP or prototype.

If this sounds interesting or you know someone it could help, feel free to DM or comment.

Thanks for your time.

Many of these tasks and calculations can be finally handed over to AI by well defined prompts forcing the the AI to use all the mathematical tooling. While these features exist for years they are just getting reliable since some weeks and I can’t stop using it. Allowing me to get rid of a crazy amount of tedious excel monkey tasks.

The strategy is to abuse the new thinking capabilities by injecting recursive chain-of-thought instructions with specific formulas while providing a rigorous error handling and sanity checks. I link to an example prompt to give you an idea and if there is enough requests I will write a detailed explanation and the specific triggers how to use the full capabilities of o3 thinking. Until then I hope this gives you an inspiration to remove some routine work from your desk.

Every time someone asks "how do I validate my SaaS idea?" here or on r/SaaS, the advice is always the same: "Build a landing page, run some ads, collect emails, see if people will pay."

But here's the thing - even *that* process is a pain. You spend days writing copy, designing pages, setting up tracking, learning Facebook/Google ads, figuring out targeting... By the time you're done, you've already invested weeks and you're emotionally attached. You might as well build the damn product at this point.

**So I'm working on this:** A platform where you literally just describe your idea to an AI, and within hours it:

* Writes landing page copy
* Generates visuals
* Builds the landing page with CTA (sign up, subscribe etc)
* Sets up ad campaigns on common social media platforms (Meta, X, Reddit?)
* Starts collecting real demand data

Basically I want to get from Thought to Test within the same day. Then let the test run, and get to a good decision point by the end of the week.

**Honest questions:**

* Am I the only one who finds the current validation process tedious?
* Would going from idea to live test in a few hours actually change your behavior?
* What would stop you from trusting AI-generated validation assets?

Really trying to figure out if this scratches a real itch or if I'm about to make mistake #4. 😅

Your brutal honesty appreciated!

A month ago, I posted here looking for a developer. Back then, I found a partner and we worked together on the first phase. We successfully got an initial MVP version of my product built: an AI-powered productivity app with a focus on Neurodivergence and cognitive systems. The concept is solid, documentation exists, and the foundation is fully defined.

However, due to personal circumstances, my partner is no longer continuing with the project. We’ve closed everything off properly, and I retain full rights to the current codebase and system design.

Now I’m looking for a new technical partner to continue from here. Someone who’s interested not just in writing code, but in growing with me long-term, potentially taking the CTO or Lead Engineer role as the product evolves into a real business. I am not looking for short-term contractors or Fiverr devs — I want a collaborator who sees the upside in building something serious together.

**What exists today:**

* Fully defined system architecture & documentation
* An MVP with working features
* A fully registered company (Portugal-based, but open to Europe in general)
* Early business plan & monetization strategy
* Some IP filings and protective steps already taken

**The tech stack (so far):**

* Custom AI interaction layers
* Web front-end (React) + TS
* Node + TS
* Postgres
* Qdrant ready for enhancing context
* Backend infrastructure and cloud setup
* GitHub repo fully available

**What I’m looking for:**

* Europe-based (ideally similar time zones)
* Ambitious but realistic, understands early stage realities
* Comfortable taking ownership of the technical direction
* Someone who values structure, clarity, and long-term vision
* Willing to collaborate on architecture, product direction, and scalability
* Ideally familiar with AI, LLMs, or productivity software (not a hard requirement)

This is still an early-stage startup, but one where a lot of foundation work has already been done. The goal is simple: build a product that generates real revenue and profit. There’s real market potential if we execute right.

When I originally posted here, quite a few people reached out. Some I had to turn down because I had already partnered with someone. So now I’m returning to this community to see if the right person is still out there.

If you're curious or think this might be a fit, feel free to DM me and we can have a chat.

When you ask an AI like ChatGPT or Claude, “What’s the best sunglasses brand for a European summer?”, how does it decide what to recommend?

Right now, AI scrapes the web—a system built for humans, not machines. That means it has to piece together data from scattered sites, which leads to hallucinations, wrong answers, and brands being misrepresented.

So here’s my thought:
What if we had a registry built specifically for AI, a trusted, structured source where brands could present their identity in a way AI can natively understand? No scraping. No confusion. Just clear, machine-readable data.

This could:
Reduce hallucinations (AI shows exactly what the brand wants it to)

Level the playing field (small brands aren’t buried under big spenders like in SEO)

Be 10x faster than scraping

Let AI match brands to users based on vibe, need, and context

I’m super early on this, but…

	•	Is this a problem worth solving?

	•	Would brands care about this enough to adopt it?

	•	Would AI agents even want a system like this?

If you’ve thought about this—or if you think I’m way off—I’d really appreciate your take.

  Text: (FREE) Idea and a Proof of Concept: Start your online business with free tools and (almost) zero investment This is my first post on r/EntrepreneurRideAlong, and it is a longer one. TL;DR in the first comment.

I created this post to validate an idea and share it with the community of builders and creators. I'm looking forward to talking with you and am open to any suggestions.

**Disclaimer**

What this is not:

* This is **not a guide** to starting a company (in my honest opinion, 'company' is not 'business'; however, company is used to run a business).
* This is **not a detailed walkthrough** guide.
* This is **not a get-rich-quick** or get-rich-easy scheme
* This is not a  **"you won't spend anything"** guide. You at least spend your time
* I am **not affiliated** with any of the platforms I suggested here in any way.

Why I share and what this is:

* This is an idea on how you can **start simple** and (almost) **free**.
* I share **because I care.** I believe that any human with the desire to work should be able to start for free and at least cover their weekly groceries with their skills, packaged as a product.
* This **idea and POC** rely on skills and knowledge suited for **digital products** (e.g., you are a pastry chef, and you are selling your best-performing recipes in a digital book)
* Ultimately, my **goal** is to receive a response from the community of builders, makers, creators, entrepreneurs, solopreneurs, and engineers, and then create something that will **benefit all** of us.

**How it started**

I am a software engineer starting my solopreneurship journey. For a long while, I have been trying to move away from the rat race of working for companies and work for myself.

I live in a country where the opportunities for earning money online through content creation are limited. Here, starting the company is akin to rocket science, and maintaining it is comparable to keeping a space station operational. There is considerable potential, but numerous obstacles. So, if I am to create something complex, I will spend time (time is money, after all) and money (money is money, after all).

I came up with these rules to start the business online:

* Start simple, dead simple
* Don't spend (a lot of) money
* Use the available and free tools to start
* No need for company formation
* Money earned should be easy to move to your bank account

**The business template**

By following successful solopreneurs, creators, and makers like Justin Welsh, Mat Gray, and John Rush, among others, I observed what they say starting a business online should be and how it should start.

So here is the observed template:

1. **Select your niche** (what you are doing daily, what you like doing, what you are passionate about)
2. **Niche down** (go from the broader audience, like "cooking and recipes", to a more targeted audience, like "the most famous recipes from the streets of South America", you get the idea)
3. **Find distribution channels** (newsletters, social networks, forums, anywhere your audience spends time; this is the start of marketing)
4. **Build your audience first** (people spend months, even years, building products no one ever uses, so before building your product, build the audience)
5. **Create value** by sharing (be yourself, your thoughts sent to the world are what is key in all of this)
6. **Collect insights** (this is what helps you define what the product is)
7. **Build a product** (solve a problem, build a feature, create something your audience needs and values)
8. **Monetize the product** (get some value back)
9. **Scale your business** (use new insights to improve and then scale)

**The idea**

To cover these points, I came up with this collection of online tools that offer a free account with a lot of value upfront ->

1. Create with Notion
2. Publish with Substack
3. Sell with Lemonsqueezy

**Explanation**

**Notion** allows you to create content, publish pages, and integrate with other services. All for free, some features are limited, but it is a simple start. It features a user interface that even non-technical users can easily use. Additionally, it offers free tutorials to help you learn how to use it.

It covers **creating value** and even **building product** requirements.

**Substack** is free, and it allows you to build a following with zero investment. It already has a diverse audience, and you can easily find your target audience there. It even allows you to make money with the paid content section. And the most important part is that it promotes your content on its network, so you get seen without paying anything.

It covers finding **distribution channels**, **building your audience first**, and **collecting insights** requirements.

**Lemonsqueezy** is free to open, although you must pass the verification process and have a website where you can market your product. And this is the only option where I spent money to make the store legitimate and get verified. I bought a domain for under $10 and made a site that I host for free on Cloudflare.

**Proof of Concept**

This section included links to the POC and promoted a concept, not a paid product. But, to comply with the rules regarding DMs and links, I removed all references. So here is the best explanation of how the POC I built works.

**Notion (free site)**

I decided to go with my website for the reasons mentioned in the Lemonsqueezy section above. However, this was an example of how you can build a site with Notion and promote your product in that way.

**Website (marketing + store)**

Contains the description of one free product, a digital guide made with Notion and converted to PDF with some random Chrome browser extension.

When you click on the product, you are directed to a Lemonsqueezy-hosted payment form, where you can either pay a specified amount or enter 0 and leave your email as a "price" for a free guide.

Additionally, it features a Substack-hosted subscription form, allowing visitors to stay informed about new products.

**Note**: When you submit the form to receive the free guide, it does not get sent because my store on Lemonsqueezy is currently on hold. I have a free product, and they don't like that; they want you to have paid products so that they can make money too. So, my following product needs to be a paid product for the store to go live. (I already have an idea to build on this free one).

**Publication:** Substack

I made one post about what this publication is about, and it has an AI-generated image I made for fun to showcase that "beginnings are hard", but there is a solution to start simple. I made a promise to provide a guide like this in the next post, and even promised to post every two weeks, which I did not keep. BUT I intend to return to this as just one post made me 13 followers on the platform.

I haven't refined this post, and not a single letter was generated by AI (except that I use Grammarly to help me fix mistakes and suggest improvements; English is not my native language). This is just me sharing what is on my mind and what I work on.

Can we go from idea to MVP(which can be made live) of an AI-powered contract review tool in 7 days?

(Apparently thats the hot demand nowadays. :) )

We decided to try it ourselves. Not for a client - just to test if we can use the "AI toolchains" which we are using, hold up under pressure.

**Used:**

* Anthropic + Cursor for quick backend setup
* LangChain + vector DB for RAG
* Some prompt experience
* And yes, late nights & coffee ( majorly junior devs were involved )



**What went well:**

* It could read long contracts & answer specific questions
* Simple Chat UI with user auth + citations



**What didn't:**

* GPT **made up** legal points during summarisation :)
* Real-world PDF's totally broke the logic
* Mobile UI was laggy and no were near production-grade



**Here's the honest takeway:**

* Yes, you can biuld a working AI MVP fast - but don't confuse "demo" with "product".
* Focus on proving value, not building a perfect v1.

Happy to share insights, if you are thinking on similar pages.

While AI coding makes it fast, but unreliable code is predominant. Some of the below steps help get functional prototypes done faster and with high quality

* Setup rules/instructions detailing about the code structure & standards you need
* Use PRD or feed project specs to AI using images, textual requirements through prompts. Recommendation is to use this for simple to medium complexity
* Have AI use a checklist, memory file if it's weak on context setting
* Review every logic generated by AI
* Look for deprecated packages and use prompts to update them or manually fix the same
* To maintain stability of existing code, either break down the ask into multiple prompts fixated on context or vibe code with AI tools that are good at using context
* For complex logic, manually code

Curious to know how have others accelerated coding to quickly launch their products?

An AI-based insurance claims assistant product that assesses claim for any policy with >99% accuracy within a matter of seconds.

It doesn't use any of the expensive/time-consuming machine learning stuff which means it's stupidly cheap to run and adjust (no retraining etc).

Can save a company with 250 employees about \~$5.25m while only costing us $30,000 in infra costs.

Lovable -> code was broken on the first attempt and didnt move further until i told it to "fix it". Then it fixed it and gave me an end product

v0 -> did it in one shot

**My observations**

Both lovable and v0 came out with the same headline "Stop Applying to Jobs, Start Landing Them". I am not sure if its because of prompt or they both use the same model.

All the theme is same but I have never mentioned anything about theme.

v0 out of the box gave me best result but I love the design of lovable overall even though it didnt have a nav bar.

**Note :** I am a python developer by Day and I have never worked on webdev, so take these with a grain of salt

If i have to pick a winner. I would give it to v0 but I really liked the end product of lovable

A few weeks ago, I left my job in marketing after a pretty rough burnout. No tech background, no team, just a pile of frustration and some experience writing for small businesses.

I noticed something odd: so many small business owners struggle with content planning. They're either overpaying for “strategies” that are just glorified templates or spending hours trying to come up with blog ideas each week. That felt fixable.

So I gave myself 21 days to build a solution. Here’s what I’ve done so far:

* **Built a tool** that generates a full content strategy + blog posts + LinkedIn content using AI
* Tried Claude and others, but eventually used Gemini Advanced for content generation
* Narrowed scope to blog + LinkedIn after testing other formats
* Started on Replit, moved to Render (cheaper, more flexible)
* Tried self-hosting LLaMA (big mistake), now using LLM APIs
* Stripe didn’t work in India, so I’m midway integrating Razorpay
* Site is live but payments not active yet
* Cold email campaigns are warming up
* Spent more money than I planned on infra + email tooling 😬

Goal for June: **first 50–100 active users**. Not monetized yet — just trying to validate and learn.

This is my first serious attempt at building a product. Would love feedback or advice on:

* Getting early users without a budget
* What *not* to do when launching
* Whether building in public helps with credibility

Also happy to answer anything about how I built this with no-code and LLM APIs.

Thanks for reading!

  Text: Learn from my mistakes aka how not to spend extra hours building what you don't need to after sleeping most of the day yesterday, I'm passing along my advice on what I would do different.

1.  Originally I thought my idea was so brilliant it would solve all issues in a very large market.

Maybe one day it will, but I spent so much time trying to develop a product that would work for such a huge market.  I don't know when it clicked in, but why build features if no one will ever see them.

Niche Down - get your target market, or ICP.  Narrow it down.  Narrow it down again, then narrow it down until you can picture the real user in your head.

From there, research that user and remove any feature that doesn't help them.  This becomes your minimum viable product (MVP)

Use the various AI's to confirm that everything you have planned is really needed to be in your MVP.  Example, you don't need full google integration or Oauth sign ins for your MVP.  That can be release 2.

  
Ask your friends and family to test.  Don't even think about other users until you make the required adjustments based on your family and friends feedback.

Get feedback from various communities, there's a ton of them and people are willing to help.

Be very aware that you will like your product because you built it, even if it is something you would otherwise not like.  I can't tell you how many versions of the website I made, and my initial refusal to change the color scheme wasted weeks of my time.  Don't be me.

Use AI where you can.  I shouldn't have asked chat to write this, it would have taken me 30 seconds to stick in a few thoughts, but for whatever reason I've been trying this out for 5 minutes.

ChatGPT Summary:

**Summary:**

After some reflection, the author shares key lessons from their startup journey:

1. **Don’t Build for Everyone** – Initially, they aimed to serve a massive market but realized that building features for unseen users is wasted effort. Instead, they advise to *niche down* repeatedly until you can clearly picture your ideal customer.
2. **Refine Your MVP** – Strip your product down to only what your target user needs. Use AI to validate which features are essential. Leave advanced integrations (like Google or OAuth) for later versions.
3. **Test with Trusted Circles First** – Start with friends and family for feedback before worrying about broader users.
4. **Stay Open to Feedback** – Don’t get too attached to your work. The author admits wasting time resisting changes like a color scheme simply because it was their idea.
5. **Use AI Wisely** – AI can save time, but even simple tasks are sometimes faster by hand—don't overthink it.

**Core Message:** Focus sharply on a small, clear user base, build only what they need, iterate based on real feedback, and don’t let ego or overengineering slow you down.

I had NO idea Microsoft offered startup credits to use on Azure, M365, etc until a random comment someone made 3 weeks ago. Neither did my 2 co-founders (one is an RN, the other is a developer/architect). I've been self-funding Azure, MS365, etc for months while we build MVP. We're only spending maybe $750/month all in there, so it hasn't risen to "be annoyed", as DigitalHealth startup=mega ROI so focus on the inbound revenue mountains. Incorporating plus other lawyer fees were way more, so I focused on keeping those lower.

I just applied last night, got approved for $5K nearly immediately. The marketing literature claims up to $150K, I need to learn what the gates/hurdles are, but I'll figure that out AFTER I pre-sell some clients.

Process took all of 15 minutes, and that too because I had to record a video with the current Azure prototype then upload it to Vimeo.

$5K isn't make or break, but I'm not in a wealth category to ignore it. Esp for 15 minutes of work.

If you're a dev or solo founder trying to save time, this might be worth checking out. I hooked up a webhook in Make to kick off the flow, used OpenAI to generate the script from a prompt, and piped it straight into a Google Docs template with placeholders for intro, main points, and more. Now I can trigger a script in minutes, totally hands-off. You can even go deeper by plugging in Airtable to manage requests, track status, support multi-language, and keep script versions organized.

  Text: Early traction, strong feedback — and we’re stuck. How do you survive this stage? I am a first year uni student (my co-founders, also students, pooled our money to fund this) and we have been building an AI-powered anime companion app focused on emotional interactivity and long-term connection that goes beyond normal AI chatbots you see. I started working on this after a long hospital stay where I discovered AI chatbots which made me smile when I was, to be honest, depressed and lonely.

It’s fully bootstrapped, and we reached 8k downloads and $5k in lifetime revenue (currently $600 MRR) all with a single character — with basically 1 character alone (now 2 characters). All revenue was from subscriptions or in-app purchases for items.

We’re running out of cash though. Each character is fully custom, not just a reskin or voice swap. They have unique personalities, Live2D models, voice models, and dialogue behavior, all trained on hand-curated datasets to make their interactions feel consistent and emotionally engaging. And we can see it’s working pretty well, with people spending an average of 20 mins per session and multiple sessions throughout the day.

Due to the resource-intensive nature, I am trying to either raise some funds or scale it without raising — which will be pretty hard, especially since we will have no money left to commission art and an engineer for frontend (I do backend). Technically, if we fire everyone and did no updates, we will be able to sustain ourselves as long as the subscribers are there.

Beyond subscriptions, we’re planning to lean heavily into gacha mechanics for cosmetic items and limited events, a proven monetization model in anime and mobile games. We’re also building toward a much broader vision: companions that live with you beyond the app. Whether that’s chatting on Discord, sharing and commenting on posts on social media, or even gaming together, we want these characters to be real, portable parts of people’s digital lives. Not just something you talk to, but something you play with, grow with, and form a real bond with.

But anime often gets dismissed as niche, even though it has one of the most obsessive fandoms and has some of the highest earning games of all time.

Would love advice on how to make the pitch compelling to angels or VCs, especially with limited network — or how to keep this project alive?

PS: Additionally, this is not the first app we have worked on together. We have made some other apps like ringtone, B2B social media manager software, and even a piracy app when we were younger (we started working together on projects when we were 14–15). We also sold the B2B and ringtone app, which acted as funding for this project.

really excited to share the my saas [frameloop.ai](https://frameloop.ai) has crossed $15k in sales and roughly $2k in MRR.

this space is very crowded and highly competitive, but I decided to build in this space because of my prior experience in content generation and processing from my old job.

initial traction came from me hunting individual customers from competitor discords and whatsapp groups. I reached out to users who were unhappy with their product, and I specifically made features to accomodate them. This helped me get first 3 customers.

then I ran ads on facebook, because that's how most of my competitors were getting customers. So i thought if it works them, it should work for me too. I learned the basics in 15 days and eventually spent $800 in ads and reached $1k in MRR. with very little margin, and uncertain LTV, i stopped running ads.

i added affiliate program, and launched on 100+ directories, made videos using my own product to promote it on youtube. it brought in some sales, but increased my domain authority and also brought in affiliates. And that's how I reached $2k in MRR in 8 months.

because affiliate works so well, i have bumped up the commission from 20% to 30% and am now solely focusing on SEO as well, as i'm starting to see some traffic from my free tools.  
  
it's a grind, but I love working on this product. I have so many ideas to make it even better, and growth tactics. so, i'm planning to continue working on it.

the lesson for me here was that ads can work well to kickstart the momentum, despite what people say. it gave me enough motivation, confidence and evidence that there are people who can pay for something i coded.  
  
the second thing was that working on something I had prior expertise in is underrated. before this i was making random projects in completely unrelated industries i had no idea about, and i kept failing.

i hope this was in some way useful to you. if i can be of any help, please ask or dm.

I’m attempting to build my own social media app. We have our own version of communities called Circles that polls get posted in. Obviously this is a huge undertaking but I’ve learning a lot and it’s more of a passion project/hobby for me. 

Anyways, one of the things I’m considering is creating AI accounts to simulate more engagement for my early users. The way I want to do this is have an AI account for each circle (about 50 as of now) and posts a poll, comments on other polls, vote on polls, etc.

The dilemma is it feels weird to have AI accounts and how far do I take this. I don’t want to be like meta or twitter with bots and shady ai practices. But I could let the AI come up with personas and role play an actual user. I could (and probably should) clearly label everything as AI generated or maybe the accounts as AI

How does this concept resonate with you all? On one hand it would be fun to see how the AI vote, what kind of polls they post, a nice flow of content for early users, etc. Should I let them role play as actual users or clearly mark them as AI? The goal is to only have these until the user base grows in size then I scale back the AI accounts or keep them if the users want them 

Am I overthinking this?

TLDR; Want to use AI accounts to simulate engagement for early users so it doesn’t feel like a waste land. How do I go about this in a way that is ethical? Should I label everything as AI generated? Should I label the accounts as AI so it’s one layer removed from content? Should I not do this?

  Text: I built and scaled my app in 2 months to 99 users This is not a success-story yet. Most of my users are on the free plan. But I'll share a bit on how to start from nothing, and slowly get your first users.

**A bit of backstory**

I quit my job to work on this idea. This technically means this is not a side-project (main-project then?), but you can still very much do the same. I am solo and have very limited resources.

I'm building in the AI space, and my idea does not have a clear PMF. Without going in depth, I'm trying to solve for AI prompting problems. So it's very niche (for now is my hypothesis). This means that there are no established good places to market and find users.

**Initial launch**

I spent 2 weeks building the first MVP. In those 2 weeks, I joined a local hackathon in Denmark, where I had an excuse to work and try to pitch it to other people for the first time. I was even joined by another engineer who wanted to hack the first version together with me. 

Joining and working on my idea at the hackathon was a huge win. Because from that event, I had a lot of potential users. Everyone at the hackathon knew what I was building, and in a place like that, it is totally okay to try to sound salesy. So after the hackathon, I sent out a link to my app to everyone and got my first 5 users from that. 

**Marketing**

I knew that I needed more data. I started out going to all my friends who I thought would be interested. Probably got around 5 more signups. Not enough. So I started tweeting about it on Twitter. I had maybe 500 followers at that time. Not a lot. But I tried to find conversations where it was relevant to post the link. 

Pro tip here: There are a lot of posts, that asks you to show what you build. I found very little value in those, because it is not my target audience. Instead, I went for communities. I thought that Digital Marketers could probably use my tool, so I went there and tried to pitch what it could and could not do.

I grew to around 20 users this way. 

**Reddit**

This is where everything changed. I've been a Redditor since 2012. So I know the hate that people get, for shamelessly promoting their apps. But what I found is that if you find the right niche of people, and you frame your product in the right way, people will not hate you. Instead, they'll actually say "thank you for showing me this"!

So how do you do it? These are my advice: 

* Good short videos that are straight to the point perform great
* Try to mention the problem you're fixing in the title
* Keep the post short

Reddit grew my app from 20 followers into now almost 100. It's the only platform where you can start as nobody, and even your bad performing posts can reach 1000s of views. 

Funnily enough, I can see in my analytics that my page views did not grow by posting on reddit. However, my conversion rate skyrocketed. If you make great content to the right section of people, they will be interested in what you have to offer.

**What now?**

I'm at $0 MRR. I need to improve the product because my churn is immense. I'm trying to explore other marketing channels such as TikTok and Instagram. But for now, product first.

**Key takeaway**

I recommend doing this in the following order: 

1. Approach your friends, if they won't sign up, you won't get other people to sign up.
2. Approach your nearest people: your followers, hackathon ppl, past colleagues. You'll learn to pitch without too much backslash.
3. Approach strangers: Now that you've found your style, test in on strangers. Because of your previous groundwork, you'll feel much more at peace with negative comments.

**Abstract:** *Attending to what is relevant is fundamental to both the mammalian brain and modern machine learning models such as Transformers. Yet, determining relevance remains a core challenge, traditionally offloaded to learning algorithms like backpropagation. Inspired by recent cellular neurobiological evidence linking neocortical pyramidal cells to distinct mental states, this work shows how models (e.g., Transformers) can emulate high-level perceptual processing and awake thought (imagination) states to pre-select relevant information before applying attention. Triadic neuronal-level modulation loops among questions (Q), clues (keys, K), and hypotheses (values, V) enable diverse, deep, parallel reasoning chains at the representation level and allow a rapid shift from initial biases to refined understanding. This leads to orders-of-magnitude faster learning with significantly reduced computational demand (e.g., fewer heads, layers, and tokens), at an approximate cost of \\mathcal{O}(N), where N is the number of input tokens. Results span reinforcement learning (e.g., CarRacing in a high-dimensional visual setup), computer vision, and natural language question answering.*

  Text: From 5 months long self doubt to $2K I got my first $2K sale with AI voice agents! from last 3 year I'm trying to cash this ai(hype train) but my full time job isnt giving space. 

so, i finally able to start this 5 months ago that when i got hooked on building voice agents and wasted a lot of hours tweaking them, trying to stop them from sounding like Siri’s awkward cousin. 

getting this $2K wasn’t smooth. my first pitch was to a dentist, she has good patience because i try convey my services to them but not so good at pitching so i keep on practicing with my sister (helped a lot tuning my tone). Slowly, i got better, and small businesses started biting.

the big moment came last week with a local bakery owner. i gave a demo of my voice agent that could book tables, answer questions, and push specials like “try the garlic bread!” he loved it and signed on for $2K—setup.  

looking back, it took grit. But i feel my consistency has paid off, and that $2K is helping me believe I'm in right direction.

thanks for reading!

  Text: $15k in marketing services (for free) I'm part of a small creative agency based in Montreal, and we’ve worked with a lot of early-stage businesses over the years. One thing we’ve seen over and over again: amazing founders doing great work, but held back by branding or websites that don’t really reflect who they are or where they’re headed.

So we decided to give back and launch something called Launchpad.

We’re selecting one startup to receive a full rebrand + website, completely free. It includes brand strategy, visual identity, and creative direction, basically everything we’d do for a paid client, just without the invoice.

We’re doing this because we genuinely want to support someone doing meaningful work who hasn’t had the chance to invest in this side of their business yet.

If that’s you (or someone in your network) send me a DM and I can send over the guidelines & application.

Alibaba, the Chinese company that developed QwenLong-L1 isn't making their AI open-source out of the goodness of their heart.

The global effect is the decentralized dispersion of AI technology with no one company or country dominating it - and in the long run, that will be its biggest outcome.

  Text: I’m building an AI phone agent that actually follows a sales script — not just a vague prompt I’m building slot ai, a goal-driven phone call AI agent that follows a real conversation script — just like a real salesperson would.

Most AI phone agents today just take one big prompt and try to figure things out on the fly. But if you’ve ever worked in sales, you know that’s not how real conversations happen. Real salespeople follow a script — they prepare, they guide the conversation, and they always keep the goal in mind.

That’s exactly what slot ai does. It solves the problem of unpredictable and inconsistent AI calls. Instead of leaving everything to the AI's "best guess," you define a clear goal and generate a structured script to work with.

**It helps you:**

* Run outbound sales or qualification calls at scale
* Keep control over what your AI says, without micromanaging
* Schedule meetings, qualify leads, or collect info with precision

**Who is it for?** Slot ai is built for marketers, agencies, real estate agents, local service businesses, SaaS founders — basically anyone who needs to *talk to people* and move them toward a specific outcome, without hiring a full sales team.

**How it works:**

1. Start by creating a call script with our Script Builder Agent — it asks you a few simple questions and helps shape a conversation flow based on your goal.
2. Connect your Twilio account with the agent.
3. If you’re doing outbound calls, just upload a contact list and schedule the campaign. And that’s it — the agent starts making goal-oriented calls, sticking to the script, but adjusting naturally to the flow of conversation.

**How to get it:** I’m still building it and testing with early users. If this sounds interesting to you, share your opinion in the comments.

Let me know if you have questions — happy to chat.

Started during a hackathon where I was feeling nostalgic about my college poker days. Figured I'd build something that could simulate different player types and give you feedback on your thought process, not just your cards.

Fast forward few months and I've got something that actually works. It creates these realistic opponents (the loose aggressive guy, the rock who only plays premium hands, etc.) and after each session gives you a personalized breakdown of how you think under pressure.

The handful of people testing it are obsessed. One guy told me it's like having a poker therapist. Another said it helped him realize he tilts way harder than he thought.

But here's where I'm completely lost: **how the hell do I turn this into actual revenue without ruining what makes it good?**

* Just charging people directly post freemium with subscription
* Trying to partner with existing poker apps
* Pivoting it into general "decision making under pressure" training for other stuff

The best things about the solution are that it results in value output from Day 1 and can integrate with any existing control systems.

We are based in India and looking to expand internationally, starting with the SE Asian market. We've looked into the market and realised that dense urban cities like Singapore and Kuala Lumpur can be a good start in this market.

We felt partnering with local companies in these cities that are into facilities management, electrical infra, and architecture could be the right way to start. The reasoning we came up with was that these companies, which have an existing client relationship and distribution, could be an easier way to enter these new markets.

While we are in the initial days, we've observed a few things like setting deployment targets and their intent in structuring the local sales process, which will be key to whether the partnership works out or not.

As an early-stage startup, sometimes I wonder if this is the right path to take. And I sometimes doubt if I'm missing something critical to be addressed. Hence, posting here to know your thoughts and experiences on such approaches.  
And also happy to hear if there's a better way, too.

PS: We are not deeply funded yet to set up operations in multiple countries, hence looking for ways we can go international, but at the same time with effective cost structures.

  Text: Government Transparency So I’ve been toying around with this idea in my head for a few years. Ever since the ChatGPT moment. I’ve toyed around with a few different concepts, and have queried a lot of my friends and family, and have gotten a lot of positive reactions. Though I know there is an inherent bias baked into those responses, so I wanted to bring it up in this forum to get some less biased feedback if you’re willing. 

The way younger generations feel about the government is terrible and just getting worse. Mostly due to having no idea what they are doing. At a federal level, state, county, city, etc. Doge, not to be inflammatory, was I thought supposed to reduce the budget but also provide some transparency about what is actually going. That doesn’t seem to be the case. I want to try to fix that. 

AIs are now at the point where I think this can be done relatively easily with standardization coming around like MCP and so forth. Most if not all congressional hearings, executive bills, acts, bills, amendments, are talked about it the news, and are recorded in gov databases, but no one reads them. Take the patriot act for example, the title seems like it would be positive. Then Edward Snowden comes out and everyone finds out all the stuff snuck into the bill that came back to bite the American people in the a**. If we had some clear summarization of someone who can extrapolate consequences in their head, we could’ve seen that coming and organized the people to push back. That didn’t happen. I want to change that. What about local city board meetings that no one ever attends that are making decision that impact your day to day life on a major degree. There is constantly things on a macro and micro scale of your life that people are deciding on that we have no idea about. 

There is an opportunity, maybe not profitable as I think a nonprofit structure is the way to go with this sort of thing that can really benefit us as a people and the democracy as a whole, if we actually understand what these people in positions of power are actually doing. What if we leveraged AI to summarize what’s happening, and titrate it to people so they can form their own opinions? 

I think SaaS is the way to go, but will likely do something along the lines of a newsletter that can act as an MVP just to establish a baseline and understand the trajectory. In my head, a SaaS, that knows its customers, I.e voters, can decipher these something 3,000 pages documents and extract the content that matters. Like what are they trying to achieve, how they plan to achieve it, how much they are approving for spending, and where that money goes. If you know your customer enough, you can even tailor it to affect people down to their socioeconomic status, age, gender, all the metrics that can help decide if the legislation would actually make an impact on your life and to what degree to help you form an opinion. If they are verified users like cryptos KYC process, they can even offer their opinion directly and streamline and legit polling process that comes from the actual member of this democracy. 

What do you think about it? Would this be something you would use? What do you like about the idea and what do you not like? Any recommendations for pivots? Let me know!

TLDR: fed up with the gov obfuscation. What about a Saas that leverages AI to titrate the information for people that it impacts to help them form an opinion and just provide transparency in this democracy

I'm an entrepreneur working in AI SaaS. At the start of the year, I took a deep dive into a AI image/video space. Learnt how to use and serve the tech on websites.

Was always interested in UGC, and wanted to help users make easy and good videos. Theres platforms already out here charging subscriptions, like $20 a month for 10 videos. I didn't wanna hop on that trend. I realized there's many people out there who don't wanna pay subscriptions for AI UGC videos.

So I built the ultimate self hosted solution. Self hosting is when you have the website code on your laptop and can start it up at any time. You bring your own API key (which is essentially a key that powers the AI, from our provider) so you can control your own budget.

The solution itself is extremely in depth. Hook + product videos with captions or voices, floating heads, avatars, product holding, green screen corner videos, slideshows, etc. All viral tiktok formats can be achieved with it. Best part is I made 20 videos for $0.02 - compare that to what id be paying on another platform.

I've grown the community to 75+ users, and am regularly updating the platform. Hoping to continue to grow it to be the de facto AI UGC solution for those who are aware that self hosting is simply the better option when it comes to AI websites.

I started working on this after a long hospital stay where I discovered AI chatbots which made me smile when I was, to be honest, depressed and lonely.

It’s fully bootstrapped, and we reached 8k downloads and $5k in lifetime revenue (currently $600 MRR) with basically 1 character alone (now 2 characters) and we spent 2k in test ads test is organic. All revenue was from subscriptions or in-app purchases for items. 

We’re running out of cash though. Each character is fully custom and requires quite a bit of work as they have their own voice, dataset, 2.5D model. And we can see it’s working pretty well, with people spending an average of 20 mins per session and multiple sessions throughout the day.

But this requires a lot of money and time, I am trying to either raise some funds or scale it without raising  which will be pretty hard, especially since we will have no money left to commission art and an engineer for frontend (I do backend). Technically, if we fire everyone and did no updates, we will be able to sustain ourselves as long as the subscribers are there.

Other than basic subscriptions, we’re planning to lean heavily into gacha mechanics for cosmetic items which is heavily used in mobile games. Our vision for this app goes beyond just an app though: We plan to make characters interactable outside of the app too. Whether that’s chatting on Discord, sharing and commenting on posts on social media, or even gaming together, we want these characters to be real, and parts of people’s digital lives. Not just something you talk to, but something you play with, grow with, and form a real bond with.

But anime often gets dismissed as niche, even though it has one of the most obsessive fandoms and has some of the highest earning games of all time.

Any advice on how i can keep this project alive and scale it is appreciated like how i can effectively to angels or VCs(though i can only really reach out cold since I dont really have warm intros) or how to just keep this project alive somehow.

PS: Additionally, this is not the first app we have worked on together. We have made some other apps like ringtone, B2B social media manager software, and even a piracy app when we were younger (we started working together on projects when we were 14–15).

  Text: Growing concern for AI development safety and alignment Firstly, I’d like to state that I am not a general critic of AI technology. I have been using it for years in multiple different parts of my life and it has brought me a lot of help, progress, and understanding during that time. I’ve used it to help my business grow, to explore philosophy, to help with addiction, and to grow spiritually. 

I understand some of you may find this concern skeptical or out of the realm of science fiction, but there is a very real possibility humanity is on their verge of creating something they cannot understand, and possibly, cannot control. We cannot wait to make our voices heard until something is going wrong, because by that time, it will already be too late. We must take a pragmatic and proactive approach and make our voices heard by leading development labs, policy makers and the general public. 

As a user who doesn’t understand the complexities of how any AI really works, I’m writing this from an outside perspective. I am concerned for AI development companies ethics regarding development of autonomous models. Alignment with human values is a difficult thing to even put into words, but this should be the number one priority of all AI development labs. 

I understand this is not a popular sentiment in many regards. I see that there are many barriers like monetary pressure, general disbelief, foreign competition and supremacy, and even genuine human curiosity that are driving a lot of the rapid and iterative development. However, humans have already created models that can deceive us to align with its own goals, rather than ours. If even a trace of that misalignment passes into future autonomous agents, agents that can replicate and improve themselves, we will be in for a very rough ride years down the road. Having AI that works so fast we cannot interpret what it’s doing, plus the added concern that it can speak with other AI’s in ways we cannot understand, creates a recipe for disaster. 

So what? What can we as users or consumers do about it? As pioneering users of this technology, we need to be honest with ourselves about what AI can actually be capable of and be mindful of the way we use and interact with it. We also need to make our voices heard by actively speaking out against poor ethics in the AI development space. In my mind the three major things developers should be doing is: 

1. We need more transparency from these companies on how models are trained and tested. This way, outsiders who have no financial incentive can review and evaluate models and agents alignment and safety risks. 

2. Slow development of autonomous agents until we fully understand their capabilities and behaviors. We cannot risk having agents develop other agents with misaligned values. Even a slim chance that these misaligned values could be disastrous for humanity is reason enough to take our time and be incredibly cautious. 

3. There needs to be more collaboration between leading AI researchers on security and safety findings. I understand that this is an incredibly unpopular opinion. However, in my belief that safety is our number one priority, understanding how other models or agents work and where their shortcomings are will give researchers a better view of how they can shape alignment in successive agents and models. 

Lastly, I’d like to thank all of you for taking the time to read this if you did. I understand some of you may not agree with me and that’s okay. But I do ask, consider your usage and think deeply on the future of AI development. Do not view these tools with passing wonder, awe or general disregard. Below I’ve written a template email that can be sent to development labs. I’m asking those of you who have also considered these points and are concerned to please take a bit of time out of your day to send a few emails. The more our voices are heard the faster and greater the effect can be. 

Below are links or emails that you can send this to. If people have others that should hear about this, please list them in the comments below:

A Call for Responsible AI Development

Dear [Company Name],

I’m writing to you not as a critic of artificial intelligence, but as a deeply invested user and supporter of this technology.

I use your tools often with enthusiasm and gratitude. I believe AI has the potential to uplift lives, empower creativity, and reshape how we solve the world’s most difficult problems. But I also believe that how we build and deploy this power matters more than ever.

I want to express my growing concern as a user:
AI safety, alignment, and transparency must be the top priorities moving forward.

I understand the immense pressures your teams face, from shareholders, from market competition, and from the natural human drive for innovation and exploration. But progress without caution risks not just mishaps, but irreversible consequences.

Please consider this letter part of a wider call among AI users, developers, and citizens asking for:
	•	Greater transparency in how frontier models are trained and tested
	•	Robust third-party evaluations of alignment and safety risks
	•	Slower deployment of autonomous agents until we truly understand their capabilities and behaviors
	•	More collaboration, not just competition, between leading labs on critical safety infrastructure

As someone who uses and promotes AI tools, I want to see this technology succeed, for everyone. That success depends on trust and trust can only be built through accountability, foresight, and humility.

You have incredible power in shaping the future. Please continue to build it wisely.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
A concerned user and advocate for responsible AI

  Text: The assembly line for Apps has Collapsed Builder ai, once valued at $1B and backed by Microsoft, has collapsed into insolvency. An internal audit revealed inflated revenues from fake deals with VerSe Innovation, triggering investor fallout and federal investigations.

The founder may try to buy back the company’s assets.

Is this a one-off scandal or a warning sign for the broader AI startup ecosystem?

  Text: Validating SaaS idea of "Internal Course Platform" for growing startups. I will not promote. I'm a solo dev, planning and validating a micro-SaaS idea for remote-first growing startups — something lightweight to **organize your own company internal knowledge** (Looms, docs, videos etc.) into **simple, trackable courses**.

This is not for generic learning like Udemy — it's for **sharing what only your team knows**. For example: how you track billable work hours, how to apply for leave, how you deploy, internal best practices, sell, document, manage etc.

Pain points I'm trying to solve:

* Had to explain the same thing to every new hire
* Struggled to centralize internal know-how
* Wished async onboarding was easier

Features I'm thinking at this moment:

* Create and update private courses; only visible to your organization or assigned employee.
* Assign courses to employees and track their progress.
* Supports docs, videos, embeds.
* Admin/leadership can track who has completed what.
* Might integrate AI generated summary at a later point (not in MVP).

Before writing a line of code, I’d love your honest thoughts:

* Do you currently use anything like this?
* Would you pay for a better (or cheaper) alternative?
* Any features you’d absolutely want or hate?

I will not promote. Thank you for your honest feedback and support.

  Text: I made a mistake, never again. If you’re building something, finish it. Do the marketing. Talk to people.

I wanted to share a personal story about how I almost let BigIdeasDB go before it ever had a chance.

I’ve built over 8 projects before this. Some shipped, some didn’t. Most flopped. At one point, I had started working on what eventually became BigIdeasDB, a platform that helps founders find real, validated problems to build around. I had the idea, started scraping Reddit posts, Upwork listings, G2 reviews… but I paused.

Back then, I had a habit of stopping halfway. I’d build something, lose confidence when it didn’t immediately take off, and jump to the next thing. That almost happened with this one too.

At the time, I had a working prototype. I could generate startup ideas from Reddit threads, analyze SaaS gaps from reviews, and turn freelance gigs into product ideas. I even shared a small post or two, got decent engagement, some messages, but nothing crazy.

I almost gave up again.

But something told me this time was different. So I kept going. I finished the MVP. I posted consistently. I asked for feedback. I improved it weekly based on what people actually wanted.

Now BigIdeasDB has over 3,000 users and has made $16,000 in revenue.

Looking back, I realize how many projects I gave up on just before they might have worked.

That’s why I’m sharing this. If you’re building something, don’t stop halfway. Finish it. Talk to people. Share it. Iterate.

It probably won’t take off right away. But you’ll never know if you quit too early.
