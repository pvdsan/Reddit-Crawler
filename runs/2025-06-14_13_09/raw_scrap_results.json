So last night during the interview where the associate wanted to know more about me, I asked them what the equity split would look like. There, I was told that the venture studio would basically act as a \"co-founder\" and they would help with the startup as well, and that's how they justified that 60% of the equity will be theirs.\nFurthermore, they told me I couldn't find outside cofounders and my co-founders will be selected by the VCs pool of candidates only. I live in Malaysia where a 100K USD is a LOT of money, but I feel like what this VC is trying to do feels suspicious. Any advice?\n\nEdit: It’s 100K USD in 2 instalment",

I talk to 3-5 SaaS founders every week 80% are building solutions to problems that don't really exist\n\nWe're like Slack but for restaurants, think Notion but specifically for real estate agents, it's basically Calendly but with AI. Man you need to stop, not everybody should have his own startup, do smth else.\n\nYou know what successful founders tell me? Customers were literally begging us to build this\n\nNot I think restaurants would like better communication. Asking for the solution ss in, they tried everything else and nothing worked.\n\nI worked with a founder last year who built construction project management software. Not because he thought construction needed better software (it obviously does), but because he ran a construction company for 10 years,tried every existing tool,none solved his actual workflow problems, his crew was literally using WhatsApp and Excel, other contractors kept asking what system he was building.\n\nThat's product-market fit before you even build.\n\nCompare that to founders who saw a market opportunity on some blog post, thought they could do X but better, built for a problem they read about but never experienced, are shocked when users don't care\n\nYour market research isn't listening to podcasts about TAM. It's having customers throw money at you to solve their pain\n\nIf you can't name 10 people who would pay for your solution TODAY, you probably shouldn't build it\n\nDo something else and usually these people assume that they will make it happen but after spending some time and money see it as a waste of time.",

    "chunk_text": "How I avoided a SaaS dispute after an ex-employee kept the account - I will not promote Just had a pretty wild first for my SaaS, and avoided a dispute!!\n\nThought the story might be worth sharing, to shed light on some tricky situations one can face...\n\nOne of our users was super active using my tool for his company. He gave regular feedback, used the product often, and seemed very involved. A few weeks in, he asked to change the account email.\n\nFrom his company one to a personal email.\n\nHe had just paid for a yearly plan, so I didn’t think twice. Seemed legit, and I switched it over.\n\nA few days later... I got an email from the same (company) email address. But it wasn’t him.\n\nBut it was someone else. The signature said \"company CEO\"\n\nThe email said the employee was no longer with the company and had used the CEO’s personal card to pay for the subscription. All without approval.\n\nThe tone was furious, written almost entirely in ALL CAPS.\n\nThe CEO demanded immediate cancellation and said she was already preparing to file a chargeback.\n\nNever ever i had seen such a use case ...\n\nHere's what I did:\n\n1. Verified the payment card name. And indeed it was matching with CEO one.\n2. Change the email to the CEO one (who paid for it on behalf of company)\n3. Reset the password and cleared any personal identifiers\n\nOnce access was reset, I email the CEO calmy, saying it took a few hours for me to investigate as this was the first time such situation happened.\n\nI said I was able to confirm her identity and ownership, and gave her full access to the account\n\nThen I offered two simple options:\n\n1. Keep using the tool (already paid for at a discounted yearly rate)\n2. Or get a full refund\n\nI was already ready to write off that revenue. And surprisingly, she chose to keep using it.\n\nShe said she actually finds it useful and she was glad she could gain access (and ex-employee couldn't walk off with the SaaS. Now they're an active user themselves.\n\n**Takeaways:**\n\n* Always verify before changing key account details\n* Keep your cool, clear, fair communication goes a long way\n* Sometimes a dispute turns into a conversion. Users mainly need reassurance.\n\nAnyone else dealt with SaaS accounts switching hands like this?\n\nI will not promote",

Hi all! \n\nDecided to tell my story, maybe you guys can learn from it smth and will see that it takes tons of time to achieve anything!\n\nI started learning programing at the age of 14, started with Python, had urge to become a dev and work remotely. At 17 i graduated from a school and decided to go with JS, to become web dev and get a job. TOTAL fail, from 10k+ applications i got 2 scam jobs and rest were \"decided to move with other candidate\". But i had skills to make websites, and i had a skill to find good looking UIs on internet, so with a best friend and only friend i have (whom i can call a brother), we decided to open a company (web agency), we are from Azerbaijan, so we started targeting local businesses!\n\nFirst 2 months were spent on socials (insta + facebook), we had no money so we bough meta ads for $20 for 2 days a week, so budget was $80 a month (super low). Anyway we got lucky and found our first client in 2 months, price was low, $400, we took $80 as a pre-payment. We invested it all back (more meta ad), and got our second client in 2 weeks, $800 this time but took 2 months to deliever it (client delayed every single detail sending).\n\nThen we had 2 months of NO sales again. Found another client a bit later, good price! So basically things with local maket didnt go good, 1-2 clients per 2 +- months, so we decided to make some changes and add 2 more locations! \n\nI was already 19 (turning 20 in 2 month), and we decided to start email outreach, we invested in total $600, got the emails, domains, started warming them up + learning, this job was 100% on my parther, so i focused on my personal brand too.\n\nWhile i was looking for a job, my linkedin already got 11k connections there but they meant nothing... so i decided to with X, posting daily and building small startups. When i turned 20 and 2 months, already had 2 failed startups, some audience on X, and working on a 3rd project. Thats where things chnaged!\n\nMy startup made $500 first month, agency still slow. Second month made $800, and first email outreach clients started showing up! Third month as my friend was on email outreach, i changed our meta ad location from azerbaijan to Dabui, meanwhile my side project made $1.9k. 4th month came (last month), made another $1.6k on side project, got first DUbai client, one of the old azerbaijani client came back and signed a contract for a bigger upgrade!\n\nHalf of june passed and things go better and better, made $924 on a side, working on a upgrade for client, and signing 2 more. We have plans to buy more Dubai meta ad, dive into google ad, and i wanna improve my product itself too!\n\nMy story was told here to inspire people not to give up, im not rich yet or super successful, but im fixing my life, in the last 3 years i have not went to any party, or gaming, anything. Ofc i had small rest sessions with my friend, but even then we spoke about the work.\n\nI wish everyone strength and luck (matters a lot!) in their journey :)",

    "chunk_text": "How I Got 600 Beta Users and 2,000 Newsletter Signups Pre-Launch Hey Everyone,\n\nI’ve been working on a productivity app (habit tracker and focus timer) for the past year, and it just got released on the App Store. It’s the first full app I’ve built, and while I’m not an expert, I’ve learned a lot through the process. Along the way, over 600 people tested the app and more than 2,000 signed up for the newsletter. It’s still very early and there hasn’t been much revenue yet, but I wanted to share what’s worked so far in case it helps anyone else building something on their own.\n\n# The Trap I Fell Into: \"Build It and They Will Come\"\n\nLike a lot of solo founders, I spent the first few months focused only on development. I figured that if I built something useful and polished, people would naturally download it.\n\nWrong.\n\nNearing having a ready product, I realised I had nobody to test it and no real validation. No feedback loop, no community, nothing. That’s when I had to switch gears and figure out how to actually get it in front of people.\n\n# How I Got My First Users Without an Audience\n\nOnce I realised I had no testers or real validation, I got to work. I created a simple landing page and a Reddit account, then started searching for the places where my target users already hung out.\n\nI looked for subreddits that aligned with what I was building. There was a subreddit for productivity apps. Another one was specifically for Forest, a competing app, where I noticed users were getting frustrated with bugs and looking for alternatives. I explored student communities, ADHD-focused spaces, digital wellness subs and pretty much anywhere people were talking about struggling with focus, motivation, or habits.\n\nReddit became my main growth channel. I’d join conversations, share my own experience with distraction and productivity, and offer lifetime free access to people who wanted to test it. That offer made a big difference. Some people worry about giving away too much, but in my case, it helped build trust and got people genuinely interested. At this stage, it’s not like giving away a few hundred free accounts is going to ruin your margins. It’s a small cost for word-of-mouth growth.\n\nWhat started as a small push turned into an active, engaged group of users who helped shape the product from the inside out.\n\n# User Feedback Made the App Way Better\n\nOnce testers started coming in, the feedback was incredibly useful. People shared suggestions I never would have thought of and pointed out things that needed changing. The app improved much faster than it ever could have if I had stayed in a bubble.\n\nEven before testing officially began, I was sending weekly updates to the newsletter. I shared progress, design decisions, and what I was working on to keep people engaged and in the loop.\n\nAfter testing started, I followed up with feedback prompts and short questionnaires. What surprised me the most was how invested people actually were. It felt surreal at times. I’ve had email chains go back and forth 15 or 20 times with people discussing the app in detail. Some testers gave deep, thoughtful feedback and clearly wanted the app to be the best version it could be.\n\nIt wasn’t just me sending updates. It started to feel like a two-way relationship. People were genuinely involved, and that made a huge difference in how the app evolved. That’s when I started to understand the value of building a real community around the product and started a subreddit.\n\n# What Didn't Work For Me\n\nI made the mistake of trying to do everything at once.\n\nI attempted to build a Twitter account, post on Instagram, explore other forums, and even learn video editing to create reels. But I had no experience and no time. Instagram lasted about a week before I burned out with no results.\n\nEventually, I pulled back and decided to focus only on Reddit. It was the one channel where I was getting real traction and consistent engagement.\n\nThere’s still time to explore other platforms. I might run Instagram ads or hire someone for video content later. But for now, staying focused has been the only way to make steady progress.\n\nStill learning a lot as I go, but if you’re building your first product or trying to grow something without an audience, I hope some of this helps. This is just what’s worked for me so far.  Feel free to ask me any questions :)\n\nIf you’ve taken a different path or found success in other ways, I’d genuinely love to hear about it. What channels worked for you early on? What helped you build momentum?\n\nAlso, if you’re curious, the app I built is a productivity tool designed to actually help you stay consistent. If you struggle with focus or sticking to your habits while building your own product, I genuinely think it could make a difference. You can start focus sessions that block distracting apps, track your daily habits, and watch your in-app city grow as you stay on track. It's called \"Telos - Focus & Habit Tracker\" on the App Store.",

I've looked into various APIs and services, but they all seem too expensive for my volume and use case.\n\nI was thinking of doing it my own way (like every startup founder does, I guess): sign up with an education email, restrict which email domains are allowed, send a verification email. If the email is valid, everything goes smoothly. If not, I just end up with a used token from my email provider.\n\nMy main concern is: How can I handle every (or almost every) education email domain out there? And how can I prevent users who still have access to their education email but aren't students anymore?\n\nHas anyone here built a different solution? I’d love to hear more about it.\n\nThanks!",

I recently became a mod of another subreddit with a similar condition, which I'm working on and has already improved quite a bit (it's r/chrome_extensions).\n\nNow with this new experience and joy of building & moderating a community, I thought it would be a great idea to become a mod of this community and make it better in terms of look and content. The good thing is that this place already has good posts and people, so I wouldn't need to do much.\n\n# So, what's next?\n\nLet me ask you all, what do YOU want? **Do you have any suggestions for some improvements?** Or do you think everything's perfect and it just needs a little bit of moderation?\n\nI'm thinking of some events we can organize like AMAs with famous indie hackers, or online meetups of us where we can talk, share and solve each other's problems.\n\nBut **let me your ideas in the comments**, I will be actively reading and replying to all of your comments.\n\nLet's make this community better together!\n\nThanks for reading, Take care <3\n\n[r\\/indiehackers banner](https://preview.redd.it/eauu8762o8ud1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=792efbbd02b3ccd39297500e60608b193c1217a7)",

    "chunk_text": "How I Got 600 Beta Users and 2,000 Newsletter Signups Pre-Launch Hey Everyone,\n\nI’ve been working on a productivity app (habit tracker and focus timer) for the past year, and it just got released on the App Store. It’s the first full app I’ve built, and while I’m not an expert, I’ve learned a lot through the process. Along the way, over 600 people tested the app and more than 2,000 signed up for the newsletter. It’s still very early and there hasn’t been much revenue yet, but I wanted to share what’s worked so far in case it helps anyone else building something on their own.\n\n# The Trap I Fell Into: \"Build It and They Will Come\"\n\nLike a lot of solo founders, I spent the first few months focused only on development. I figured that if I built something useful and polished, people would naturally download it.\n\nWrong.\n\nNearing having a ready product, I realised I had nobody to test it and no real validation. No feedback loop, no community, nothing. That’s when I had to switch gears and figure out how to actually get it in front of people.\n\n# How I Got My First Users Without an Audience\n\nOnce I realised I had no testers or real validation, I got to work. I created a simple landing page and a Reddit account, then started searching for the places where my target users already hung out.\n\nI looked for subreddits that aligned with what I was building. There was a subreddit for productivity apps. Another one was specifically for Forest, a competing app, where I noticed users were getting frustrated with bugs and looking for alternatives. I explored student communities, ADHD-focused spaces, digital wellness subs and pretty much anywhere people were talking about struggling with focus, motivation, or habits.\n\nReddit became my main growth channel. I’d join conversations, share my own experience with distraction and productivity, and offer lifetime free access to people who wanted to test it. That offer made a big difference. Some people worry about giving away too much, but in my case, it helped build trust and got people genuinely interested. At this stage, it’s not like giving away a few hundred free accounts is going to ruin your margins. It’s a small cost for word-of-mouth growth.\n\nWhat started as a small push turned into an active, engaged group of users who helped shape the product from the inside out.\n\n# User Feedback Made the App Way Better\n\nOnce testers started coming in, the feedback was incredibly useful. People shared suggestions I never would have thought of and pointed out things that needed changing. The app improved much faster than it ever could have if I had stayed in a bubble.\n\nEven before testing officially began, I was sending weekly updates to the newsletter. I shared progress, design decisions, and what I was working on to keep people engaged and in the loop.\n\nAfter testing started, I followed up with feedback prompts and short questionnaires. What surprised me the most was how invested people actually were. It felt surreal at times. I’ve had email chains go back and forth 15 or 20 times with people discussing the app in detail. Some testers gave deep, thoughtful feedback and clearly wanted the app to be the best version it could be.\n\nIt wasn’t just me sending updates. It started to feel like a two-way relationship. People were genuinely involved, and that made a huge difference in how the app evolved. That’s when I started to understand the value of building a real community around the product and started a subreddit.\n\n# What Didn't Work For Me\n\nI made the mistake of trying to do everything at once.\n\nI attempted to build a Twitter account, post on Instagram, explore other forums, and even learn video editing to create reels. But I had no experience and no time. Instagram lasted about a week before I burned out with no results.\n\nEventually, I pulled back and decided to focus only on Reddit. It was the one channel where I was getting real traction and consistent engagement.\n\nThere’s still time to explore other platforms. I might run Instagram ads or hire someone for video content later. But for now, staying focused has been the only way to make steady progress.\n\nStill learning a lot as I go, but if you’re building your first product or trying to grow something without an audience, I hope some of this helps. This is just what’s worked for me so far.  Feel free to ask me any questions :)\n\nIf you’ve taken a different path or found success in other ways, I’d genuinely love to hear about it. What channels worked for you early on? What helped you build momentum?\n\nAlso, if you’re curious, the app I built is a productivity tool designed to actually help you stay consistent. If you struggle with focus or sticking to your habits while building your own product, I genuinely think it could make a difference. You can start focus sessions that block distracting apps, track your daily habits, and watch your in-app city grow as you stay on track.

Hey [r/MachineLearning](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/),  \nI wanted to share a project I've been working on called HandFonted.

The ML model is central, but its success depends heavily on the pre-processing and post-processing steps.\n\n* **1. Input & Segmentation:**\n   * A user uploads a single image containing handwritten characters.\n   * The image is processed with **OpenCV**: converted to grayscale, adaptive thresholding is applied, and contours are detected to isolate each character into its own bounding box.\n* **2. Classification & Assignment:**\n   * Each isolated character image is fed into a pre-trained **PyTorch (ResNet-Inception) model**.\n   * The model outputs a probability matrix for all characters against all possible classes (A-Z, a-z).\n   * The **Hungarian algorithm** (linear\\_sum\\_assignment) is used to find the optimal one-to-one assignment, ensuring each character image is mapped to a unique letter.\n* **3. Vectorization & Font Generation:**\n   * The now-classified character images are converted from raster (pixels) to vector outlines using scikit-image.\n   * The **fontTools** library assembles these vector glyphs into a standard .ttf file, mapping each one to its correct Unicode character.\n* **Limitations:** The system currently assumes input image has a clearly separated characters on a plain white background to work best.\n\nThis project was a fantastic learning experience in building a practical, end-to-end ML system.

Using the second iteration of an LLM \"debugger\" I've been working on, I compare the hypothetical representations used in the tutorial to the actual representations I see when extracting a circuit that describes the processing of this specific sentence.

With the understanding that any revaluation must start from scratch, and no further training can happen on an instance of the model that has touched the validation data? \n\nBasically what are actual production (not just academics) best practices around this idea?\n\nI'm moving from a research setting to an industry setting and interested in any thoughts on this.",

    "chunk_text": "[R] CausalPFN: Amortized Causal Effect Estimation via In-Context Learning Foundation models have revolutionized the way we approach ML for natural language, images, and more recently tabular data. By pre-training on a wide variety of data, foundation models learn general features that are useful for prediction on unseen tasks. Transformer architectures enable in-context learning, so that predictions can be made on new datasets without any training or fine-tuning, like in TabPFN.\n\nNow, the first **causal foundation models** are appearing which map from observational datasets directly onto causal effects.\n\n🔎 CausalPFN is a specialized transformer model pre-trained on a wide range of simulated data-generating processes (DGPs) which includes causal information. It transforms effect estimation into a supervised learning problem, and learns to map from data onto treatment effect distributions directly.\n\n🧠 CausalPFN can be used out-of-the-box to estimate causal effects on new **observational** datasets, replacing the old paradigm of domain experts selecting a DGP and estimator by hand. \n\n🔥 Across causal estimation tasks not seen during pre-training (IHDP, ACIC, Lalonde), CausalPFN outperforms many classic estimators which are tuned on those datasets with cross-validation. It even works for policy evaluation on real-world data (RCTs). Best of all, since no training or tuning is needed, CausalPFN is much faster for end-to-end inference than all baselines.\n\n\narXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07918\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/vdblm/CausalPFN\n\n`pip install causalpfn`",

    "chunk_text": "[R] Analyzing paths datapoints take through clustered latent space with LLMs Hello,\n\nI am an independent researcher who is having some issues getting a signal out. I want to get some feedback on my work as well, I am far from an expert, but I think it is interesting.\n\nBasically my approach involves using different clustering approaches to cluster 'activation vectors' within different layers of a NN and then track the paths different datapoints take through those clusters. We care more about how the NN organizes the population thus it is a geometric approach rather than one probing individual weights.\n\nThe biggest innovation in my mind really is the use of LLMs to label the clusters based on the population, and then with that analyze and label the different common pathways datapoints take (the archetypal paths).  Anyways here is a picture showing an experiment tracing 'individual tokens' through GPT2 (early window).\n\nNote at the bottom pronouns get split into 'content human/social' and 'functional determiners' at the bottom (semantic purity scores show the percentage of tokens on that path that are of that category). This is somewhat arbitrary as I am tracking individual tokens and many pronouns can be both. The next one is to show how a second embedding would shift the routing from one path to the other (we have a cluster shift scoring metric).\n\nAnyways here is my paper: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aBXxKCsaAJvWbOrJpG6arhdro4XrzAMa/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aBXxKCsaAJvWbOrJpG6arhdro4XrzAMa/view?usp=sharing)\n\nThe main issues theoretically we somewhat talk about in the paper. First k-means is a heuristic so it will give us a rough lense. This is ok - astronomers do just fine with rough lenses but we do want to find a 'geometrically sound' approach to clustering in latent space. I am exploring hierchical clustering to break down bigger clusters into microclusters, explainable thershold similarity which is a new distance measure that makes more sense versus euclidean and such, and then just rigorous testing of the clustering - can we extract rules from these pathways which match expert systems, can we reproduce clusters over different seeds, etc.\n\nLet me know what you think!",

    "chunk_text": "My SaaS Product Got Its First $100! 🎉 Hey Everyone,\nI can't believe this moment is finally here. My SaaS product just made its first $100, and I’m over the moon in excitement.\n\nA Little Backstory:\nI started this journey with just an idea. A small, scrappy prototype built during late nights, fueled by endless cups of coffee (and a few mental breakdowns 😅). Honestly, I doubted myself a million times. Who would care about my product? Who would even pay for it?\n\nBut last night, as I was about to go to bed, I got the notification. You know the one – \"You've received a payment of $19.” Although it didn’t seem like much, I checked my Stripe account and there it was, the big 100. It took me a second to process, and then it hit me like a freight train.\n\nWhat My Product Does:\nThe product is a Reddit marketing/growth tool that helps people grow their product more on Reddit. It’s not a spam tool or anything like that, but it helps make the right type of posts so you can get some engagement, and it also has lead generation so you can find potential customers that way.\nIt’s aimed at small founders, businesses, marketers, and anyone who wants an easier way to grow on Reddit. And clearly, there’s at least one person out there who saw enough value to subscribe!\n\nWhy This Means So Much to Me:\nI’m not some big startup founder with investors throwing money at me. I don’t have a fancy office or a huge team. It’s just me, grinding every day, figuring things out as I go. This $100 is so much more than just money, it’s validation. It’s proof that someone, somewhere, found enough value in what I’ve built to actually pay for it.\n\nWhat’s Next?\nFor me, this is just the beginning. Now that I know people are willing to pay, it’s time to double down. More features, more marketing, and maybe even more subscriptions? Let’s see how far this can go.\nThanks for reading, and if you’ve been grinding on your own project, let’s hear about it in the comments. Let’s inspire each other.\nYou can check my product here: https://www.tydal.co",

For months, I had no social life, progress felt slow, and I completely burnt out. I love building, but the marketing part is super unpredictable and draining. Nothing I did seemed to work, and honestly, I was feeling pretty blue in the end of the day.\n\nI took a few days off, spent some time with my girlfriend, stared at a wall, and had a realization that my problem was trying to do everything myself.\n\nI decided to delegate one task at a time, I focused on the 3 channels that actually got me users: Blog Posts, Brand Placements, and Organic Content.\n\nI started with blog, my process is simple but effective:(a bit unethical)\n\nI find high-quality, relevant articles from writers on medium and substack that is relevant to my product.\nI feed them into Gemini 2.5 Pro with a prompt to rewrite the core concepts for my site's audience.\nI run the output through AI text humanizer to change the robotic tone and ai lingo.\nLastly I did a bit of manual editing to inject my own tone and examples.\nI get decent organic traffic for about 20 minutes of work per post. \n\nps. If you just copy-paste from an AI, Google’s crawlers detect it somehow and won’t index it.  A bit of after-touch is very useful.\n\n2. Brand Placements\nI tried building a DIY workflow with social media APIs to get my product mentioned in relevant threads, but it is a freaking nightmare. It is fragile, high-maintenance, and the Twitter API alone was going to be $200/month.\n\nI switched to a tool called Mentio. It automatically places product mentions where people are looking for similar solutions in all socials. I just spend a few minutes at the end of the day reviewing the mentions and giving the algo feedback to sharpen its aim and outputs.\n\n3. Organic Content\nThis part is still a mess. I've tried a bunch of tools that overpromise and underdeliver:\n\nReelFarm for UGC TikToks (good, not for me)\nA dozen others I won't name\nThe core problem is most tools still require constant input. You have to come up with ideas, edit, and deal with broken schedulers. Right now, I only actively use Typefully to organize tweets, but it's still manual labor.\n\nI haven't found a tool that can take one of my blog posts and properly repurpose it into a full content suite: a Twitter thread, a LinkedIn post, a Reddit discussion starter, and a TikTok script. (If you know something like that shoot me a DM please)\n\nWhoever builds that properly will print money. It's a heavy-lift product, but the demand is massive.\n\nNo gatekeeping here, happy to chat about my stack or process!",

    "chunk_text": "I am 15, built Linkeddit between math class and lunch, hit #1 on Product Hunt, and now it’s past $1K MRR — here’s the play-by-play Wanted to share how I built **Linkeddit**, a tool that finds Reddit experts for networking, while juggling high school this year.\n\n**Where it started** I spend way too much time browsing BigIdeasDB after finishing homework. Saw someone complaining about how hard it is to find actual experts on Reddit - they're buried in comment threads with no easy way to connect. Made me think: what if there was a tool that could surface the best Redditors in any niche, kind of like how LinkedIn suggests connections?\n\n**Building it piece by piece** My setup was pretty basic - just Cursor IDE on an old Chromebook. Went with Next.js and Supabase since I didn't want to mess with complex backend stuff.\n\nThe timeline was all over the place:\n\n* Sketched the initial idea during biology class\n* Built the first prototype during lunch breaks\n* Pushed updates on the bus ride home\n\nI had to work in 50-minute chunks between classes, so if a feature couldn't get done in one period, I'd break it down smaller.\n\n**Getting it out there** Posted a quick demo GIF on r/webdev and people started asking for access. Figured I might as well throw Stripe on it and charge $19/month to see if anyone would actually pay.\n\nGot 120 beta users in two weeks. My teachers definitely noticed I was more tired than usual.\n\nFor Product Hunt, I scheduled the launch for midnight EST and wrote up the whole story. Asked the beta users to help out and we ended up hitting #1 Product of the Day with about 1,400 signups in 24 hours.\n\n**Making actual money** About 14% of free users converted once they saw their first expert recommendations. The biggest growth hack was adding a simple \"invite a friend, get a free month\" banner in the app. Didn't cost anything to implement and doubled the paid user count in three weeks.\n\n**What I learned** Validating fast was huge. BigIdeasDB basically handed me a validated problem - I just had to build the minimum viable solution.\n\nHaving limited time actually helped. I had to cut features ruthlessly and focus on what actually mattered. Half the stuff I originally wanted to build is still sitting in my notes.\n\nDistribution beats features every time. Two Twitter threads and the Product Hunt launch drove most of my revenue so far.\n\nYou learn more by shipping broken stuff than by reading tutorials. I completely messed up my first Supabase security rules and had to fix them live in production, but that taught me more than any documentation would have.\n\n**Current status** Still balancing homework with customer support emails, but Linkeddit now covers my phone bill, gym membership, and way too much bubble tea.\n\nHappy to answer questions about the technical side, Product Hunt strategy, or how to explain Stripe revenue charts to school administrators as a \"computer science project.\"",

TargetJS introduces a distinctly innovative approach to this concept: it enables methods to react exclusively to their immediately preceding counterparts, fostering a declarative and simple code flow.\n\nTargetJS also brings in a second key concept: it unifies both variables and methods into a new construct called “Targets”. Targets also provide state, loops, timing, and more, whether it's a variable or a function.\n\nWhen these two ideas are combined: code-ordered reactivity and Targets, they unlock a fundamentally new way of coding that simplifies everything from animations and UI updates to API calls and state management. The result is code that is not only more intuitive to write but also significantly more compact.\n\nReady to learn more?\n\n🔗 **Visit:** [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/livetrails/targetj)",

In high school (grades 9–11), I was the best student in my class at math. I really liked it and wanted to study higher mathematics.\n\nNow I’m studying Computer Science at university and aiming to become a software developer. My question is about the actual level of higher mathematics knowledge required for a programmer.\n\nOf course, math is essential, but the specific areas you need depend on your field. For example, machine learning and systems programming require deep knowledge of probability theory, statistics, linear algebra, mathematical analysis, and discrete math.\n\nTo create new algorithms or be an advanced developer, you definitely need higher math.\n\nHowever, here’s my problem:  \n\nI struggle to memorize all the theory presented in lectures. I don’t remember all the integration or differentiation methods. When I face a mathematical problem, I usually can't solve it right away. I have to look up the method or algorithm, study some examples, and only then can I solve it — which takes time.\n\nSo I’d like to ask developers who regularly deal with advanced mathematics:  \n\nWhen you're faced with a math-heavy problem, do you immediately know which method to use and remember the formulas by heart? Or do you also have to look things up and review examples?\n\nAlso, will I fail an interview for a systems programmer or ML developer if I don’t know all the higher math theory by heart? What if I can't solve a math problem on the spot?\n\nLastly, I’m worried that in real work I’ll spend too much time solving math problems, which might not be acceptable for employers.",

I am really interested in computer graphics and low-level systems, and at the minute I am in my senior year of college.  I didn't get an internship and all I am doing at the minute is working, and one thing I would really like to make is a raytracer.  I am not necessarily a stranger to graphics, as I worked alongside the LearnOpenGL book and finished most of it up to the section on PBR.  However, I am not sure if my approach to that book was the best and it ended up taking me a really long time to internalize the concepts, and even at that, now I wouldn't even know simple things like more advanced yet standard lighting techniques.  \n\nTo prevent wasting a lot of time and actually learn better, I was wondering what is the best way to read a programming/CS book/textbook?  I am at the moment reading the Raytracing in a weekend series (going to read all 3 books), and then I would like to read the PBRT book.  I noticed that there is a lot of given code and concepts in raytracing in a weekend, as well as PBRT, and I am wondering if I should just read it, or if I should be programming alongside it.  Or maybe I should read it first and then try to apply it? but then by then I have forgotten everything.\n\nI dont know but any help I very much appreciate.

Hello, just for some context I am currently in my last year of college studying info sys and I have recently come to really enjoy programming (by recently I mean for the past year or so) I was exploring all kinds of different stacks like web , embedded, gpus, graphics, OS, game dev, enterprise etc. Overall I really enjoyed exploring all the possibilities that seem pretty much endless in terms of programming.\n\nI am at a crossroads because I am stuck picking what path to take a focus on. On one end I know and am confident that I can get productive and possibly find a job faster if I studied java and set my sights towards a career there. Since there are a lot of domains that use it and it is immense in terms of usage and also one of the only stacks in which people seemed to actually want to hire juniors. \n\nOn the other end I really enjoy C++ and have loved diving into the low level aspects, particularly in graphics and games. I know that I would be happier working on games but it seems like most places do not even hire juniors developers anymore in any domain that involves C++. I also just really enjoy the language and how powerful it feels to have to ability to handle it all yourself (similar to C). I have also heard that games industry is super competitive and any other domain involving C++ requires years if not decades of experience. \n\nI was wondering what advice you would give to someone like me who would be happier elsewhere but also cares about employment. I have read and understand that I shouldn't marry to a particular language or stack but for something like C++ that takes years to get decent at it feels like I almost need to just make a decision in order to give myself the best chance. \n\n\n\nThanks,",

    "chunk_text": "pmGenerator 1.2.2 released: Extended proof compression and natural deduction to Hilbert-style conversion pmGenerator, since [release version 1.2.2](https://github.com/xamidi/pmGenerator/releases/tag/1.2.2), can\n\n- compress Hilbert-style proofs via exhaustive search on user-provided proof data\n- convert Fitch-style natural deduction proofs of propositional theorems into any sufficiently explored Hilbert system\n\n### Fitch-style natural deduction\n\nFor demonstration, here's a proof constructor to try out natural deduction proof design: https://mrieppel.github.io/FitchFX/  \nMy converter is using the same syntax (with \"[Deduction Rules for TFL](https://mrieppel.github.io/FitchFX/samples/quick-ref-rules.pdf)\" only). Some exemplary proofs are: [m_ffx.txt](https://xamidi.github.io/pmGenerator/data/m_ffx.txt), [w1_ffx.txt](https://xamidi.github.io/pmGenerator/data/w1_ffx.txt), …, [w6_ffx.txt](https://xamidi.github.io/pmGenerator/data/w6_ffx.txt) — of the seven minimal single axioms of classical propositional logic with operators {→,¬}. These files can also be imported via copy/paste into the FitchFX tool under the \"Export / Import\" tab.\n\n### Usage\n\nMy converter (`pmGenerator --ndconvert`) uses aliases by default (as mentioned in [nd/NdConverter.h](https://github.com/xamidi/pmGenerator/blob/1.2.2/nd/NdConverter.h?ts=4)) rather than treating connectives other than {→,¬} as real symbols and operators, with the same aliases that are used by Metamath's [pmproofs.txt](https://us.metamath.org/mmsolitaire/pmproofs.txt). There is also the option `-h` to use heterogeneous language (i.e. with extra axioms to define additional operators). But then the user must also provide rule-enabling theorems in order to enable their corresponding rules for translation.\n\nMy procedure can translate into all kinds of propositional Hilbert systems, as long as the user provides proofs of (A1) `ψ→(φ→ψ)` and (A2) `(ψ→(φ→χ))→((ψ→φ)→(ψ→χ))` together with sufficient information for the used rules. When using {→,¬}-pure language, providing a proof for (A3) `(¬ψ→¬φ)→(φ→ψ)` in addition to (A1), (A2) is already sufficient to enable all rules.\n\nFor example, [m.txt](https://xamidi.github.io/pmGenerator/data/m.txt) (which is `data/m.txt` in the release files) can be used via\n\n```\npmGenerator --ndconvert input.txt -n -b data/m.txt -o result.txt\n```\n\nto generate a proof based on ([meredith](https://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/meredith.html)) as a sole axiom, for whichever theorem there is a FitchFX proof in `input.txt`. All rules are supported since m.txt contains proofs for (A1), (A2), and (A3). Since it also contains a proof for `p→p` that is shorter than building one based on `DD211`, resulting proofs use the corresponding shortcut.  \n\nResults can then be transformed via\n\n```\npmGenerator --transform result.txt -f -n […options…] -o transformedResult.txt\n```\n\nand optionally be compressed with `-z` or `-x` to potentially find fundamentally shorter proofs. When exploring new systems, the hardest part can be to find the first proofs of sufficient theorems (or figure out they don't exist).\n\n### Key concepts for conversion\n\n[**Note**: In the following, exponents ⁿ (or \\^n) mean n-fold concatenation of sequences, and `D` stands for (2-ary) condensed detachment in prefix notation, i.e. most general application of modus ponens, taking a proof of the conditional as first and a proof of the antecedent as second argument.]  \n\n- Most rules can be enabled by using a corresponding theorem. For example, `p→(q→(p∧q))` can be used — in combination with two modus ponens applications — to apply **conjunction introduction**, i.e. `∧I: Γ∪{p,q}⊢(p∧q)`. There may be multiple rule-enabling theorems, for example `p→(q→(q∧p))` can accomplish the same thing by changing the order of arguments. I provided a table of rule-enabling theorems at [nd/NdConverter.h](https://github.com/xamidi/pmGenerator/blob/1.2.2/nd/NdConverter.h?ts=4).\n- **However**, in natural deduction proofs, there are blocks at certain depths, each starting with an assumption.  \n  For example, `∧I: Γ∪{p,q}⊢(p∧q)` at depth 3 is actually `Γ∪{a→(b→(c→p)),a→(b→(c→q)}⊢a→(b→(c→(p∧q)))`. Fortunately, such variants can easily be constructed from the zero-depth rule-enabling theorems:  \n  For symbols `1` := (A1) and `2` := (A2), the proof σ_mpd(d) for σ_mpd(0) := `D` and σ_mpd(n+1) := (σ_mpd(n))²(`D1`)ⁿ`2` can be used to apply modus ponens at depth d. For example, σ_mpd(0) is ([ax-mp](https://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/ax-mp.html)), σ_mpd(1) is ([mpd](https://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/mpd.html)), and σ_mpd(2) is ([mpdd](https://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/mpdd.html)). (Metamath does not contain σ_mpd(d) for d ≥ 3.)  \n  Every theorem can be shifted one deeper by adding an antecedent via preceding its proof with `D1`, i.e. with a single application of ([a1i](https://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/a1i.html)).  \n  In combination with σ_mpd, rule-enabling theorems can thereby be applied at any depth. I gave detailed constructions of all supported rules at [nd/NdConverter.cpp#L538-L769](https://github.com/xamidi/pmGenerator/blob/1.2.2/nd/NdConverter.cpp?ts=4#L538-L769).\n- We cannot simply make use of some rule-enabling theorem to translate **conditional introduction**, i.e. `→I: from Γ∪{p}⊢q infer Γ⊢(p→q)`, since it handles the elimination of blocks and depth, which is necessary because Hilbert-style proofs operate on a global scope everywhere. Other rules just call it in order to eliminate a block and then operate on the resulting conditional.  \n  To eliminate an assumption `p` for a caller at depth d, we can replace it with an appropriate proof a1_a1i(n, m) with d = n+m+1 of either `a₁→(…→(aₘ→(p→p))…)` for n = 0, or `a₁→(…→(aₘ→(p→(q₀→(q₁→(…→(qₙ→p)…)))))…)` for n > 0, when the assumption is used from a position n deeper than the assumption's depth m+1.  \n  We can construct a1_a1i(n, m) based on `1` := (A1) and `2` := (A2) via a1_a1i(0, m) := (`D1`)\\^m`DD211`, and a1_a1i(n, m) := (`D1`)\\^m(`DD2D11`)ⁿ`1` for n > 0. Note that `DD211` and `D2D11` are just proofs of `p→p` and `(p→q)→(p→(r→q))`, respectively. In combination with modus ponens, the second theorem can be used with conditionals to slip in additional antecedents.\n- In general, we can use `(p→q)→(p→(r→q))` in combination with (a1i) to construct proofs slip(n, m, σ) from proofs σ to slip in m new antecedents after n known antecedents for a known conclusion. This makes the implementation — in particular due to the possible use of reiteration steps — much simpler: Regardless of from which depth **and with how many common assumptions** a line is called, the appropriate numbers of antecedents can be slipped in where they are needed in order to rebuild σ's theorem to match the caller's context.  \n- Since the final line in the Fitch-style proof makes the initial call and (for correct proofs without premises) must be in the global scope, all lines can be fully decontextualized, i.e. transformed into theorems, in this manner.\n\nThe core of the translation algorithm can be found at [nd/NdConverter.cpp#L815-L947](https://github.com/xamidi/pmGenerator/blob/1.2.2/nd/NdConverter.cpp?ts=4#L815-L947) (definition and call of recursive lambda function `translateNdProof`).",

It’s part of my little experiment I’ve been doing: trying to explain tricky CS concepts not just with text, but also with interactive tools you can play with directly in the browser.\n\nThis post covers the classic Bloom filter from scratch, how it works, what makes it efficient, where it breaks down, and how to configure it properly. I’ve also built inside article:\n\n* A live demo to insert and query strings and visually explore how bits get flipped.\n* A calculator to explore trade-offs between size, hash count, and false positive probability.\n\nThe article is quite detailed, but I tried to keep the material beginner-friendly and explain things in a way that would make sense to practical engineers.\n\nIf you're curious, feel free to give it a read, and I’d really appreciate any thoughts or suggestions, especially if something feels confusing or could be explained better.\n\n[https://maltsev.space/blog/008-bloom-filters-pt1](https://maltsev.space/blog/008-bloom-filters-pt1)",

It would make sense, but every proof I've found doesn't talk about how many gates are there and if these gates affect n, which they should, right? I can have a million inputs and just one gate and the complexity would be trivial, or i can have two inputs and a million gates and the complexity would be enormous, but in the proofs I've seen this isn't talked about (maybe because it's implicit and has been talked about before in the book?).\n\nThanks in advanced!!\n\nEDIT: I COMPLETELY MISSPOKE, i said \"outputs\" when i should've said \"inputs\".

    "chunk_text": "Why do people prefer MacOS (and Linux) for web development? I recently developed a full-stack app, and while I know it’s not perfect, the development process on Windows was surprisingly seamless. Deploying the app to GitHub and then to platforms like Render and Netlify was straightforward. The only real challenge I encountered was properly configuring environment variables.\n\nAlthough I also own a Mac, I mainly use it for lightweight tasks like checking email or watching videos. I recently tried setting it up for a new development project and found it to be quite frustrating. For example, PgAdmin presented a host of unusual issues that I never faced on Windows. Application management also felt inconsistent. Some apps install to the Launchpad, others land in random directories, and some just seem to “exist” through Homebrew. I also don’t find myself using PowerShell or other CLI tools often, so the heavy reliance on the terminal in Unix-based systems feels unintuitive to me.\n\nI understand some of this is likely due to my limited experience with Unix-like systems and command-line interfaces. Still, I can’t help but wonder: is there really still a strong advantage to doing web development on macOS or Linux? From my experience so far, navigation, installation, and tool compatibility seem worse compared to Windows.\n\nI’ve often heard the argument that Linux is the standard for most production servers and that developing in an environment similar to your deployment environment makes sense, especially for complex systems involving microservices, Docker, Kafka, Spark clusters, and the like. But does that same logic apply to simpler setups, like a typical React and Node.js app that doesn’t rely on real-time data streaming or distributed systems?\n\nIs my frustration just a result of inexperience? Should I push through and try to become more comfortable using macOS for development, or is it perfectly fine to stick with Windows (without WSL) if it works well for me?",

I spent weeks checking every widget very confused until I found it.\n\nIt's hidden, but it's in every tag/category section on steam. It's not in your face, but there for every steam user. The section is called \"Coming Soon\". Under the browse section of every tag page.\n\nThis is not a coming soon widget, it's a fake name. This is wishlist velocity widget.\n\nThe way it works it's very simple.\n\nThere is 21 slots in this widget, 21 slots PER tag.\n\nIt resets around daily? (I haven't crunched the exact timing of this widget) And it will check how much wishlists you have gotten in the past day or so.\n\nIt will rank you and pick the top 21 games that gained the most wishlists that day.\n\nBefore I say more, here is a way you can fact check this. I'll provide an example that's for nsfw games (that's my genre)\n\nhttps://steamdb.info/stats/trendingfollowers/?category=888&min_release=2025-06-15\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/adultonly/\n\nSteamdb has a feature to track trending followers past 7 days. While this is not wishlists it's the only public data we can use to study this. You will notice that the adult only coming soon section matches very well with the trending followers list.\n\nThis tells us the wishlist velocity is calculated at max past 7 days, but I really think it's just a daily measure.\n\nWhat are my conclusion and why is this useful?\n\n1. It proves that gaining a burst of wishlist at ANY point pre-release puts you on this list. If your game is captivating, you can keep riding this list forever. If not you drop off and try again later.\n\n2. Tags are essential part of steam, and this is an other big reasons why. You want to dominate smaller tags sections and slowly climb to the good tags. Remember you have a total of 20 tags, each one is important here. Some tags don't even have a section... Maybe that means that tag.. sucks?\n\n3. Visibility on your competition, what games similar to you look like, a goal that you can aim for. It's not a blind game anymore, you have something to compete for everyday before release. \n\n\nI know there will be a lot of questions, likely this post isn't 100% clear. But happy to answer things I missed to explain, please ask away.",

And then down the road it's incredibly incredibly essential for playtesting, because your playtesters are absolutely going to get into broken game states you need to figure out, and you'd better believe that post-release you're going to be getting bug reports where you need to figure out WTF happened, not even to mention how critical it becomes to have metrics for player behavior.\n\nIf I had to pick one system to just have working perfectly from the beginning of development, it would be logging!",

I have always loved games, art(currently draw for a hobby) and always wanted to create something people can enjoy. I know starting small is the best way but looking into things i fear there are so many starting points.  \nFor starters not sure if i should start learning the basic of game engines or try and learn code languages first. Should i try character creation and get inspired for the unique things i can create or is there another starting point I should look into. For some background i have very limited experience in code language as I touch on some at my job, currently most familiar with DAX (yes I know DAX stinks lol). I have limited experience in blender for 3D modeling and currently messing around in unreal engine. So not sure the best route to focus on. \n\nOverall, I know this is a long process and I want to do this as a passion hobby. I am not worried about the time and just want to get the basic and bring creations to life. I feel the best thing is to find a group if peeps and talk with them about things so that why i came here hoping you all can grant some insight into game dev journeys\n\nAnything helps!

Great, now how do I get a steady stream of clients so this can actually be a business.\n\nStart local. It's much easier to start in your local area. You'll have some natural credibility since you live in the area. If you don't have a portfolio, you'll need one. Very few business owners are going to hire you without seeing your work. If you don't have one, offer four local businesses a free website in exchange for a review. This might be controversial but it gets you established and kicks off your Google reviews.\n\nBecome a hosting reseller and create a package for site maintenance, security and updates. That will build a stream of recurring income.\n\nNext, get a list of business owners in your area. You can buy lists - I buy aged lists; $50 for 5,000 business listings. Then I Google their sites, identify the ones that don't have a site (only FB) ones that suck; outdated, not responsive, and call them. At this stage, I have two telemarketers working for me - they make the calls and book my appointments.\n\nJoin your local chamber of commerce. Not only does it give you a backlink but increases your level of credibility. Anytime you finish a local site, ask for referrals. Business owners know each other.\n\nHave fun.",

The $4k-$8k quotes say they're doing custom design, and the $13k-$17k quotes say those guys claim they're doing custom design, but are in reality just customizing templates, while their sites will be coded from the ground up, and involve weeks of brand analysis and planning beforehand. \n\nHere is the quote request email I sent the companies as an outline. Our SEO account manager and marketing lead provided many of the points to include in this email. If anyone can offer feedback here to help orient me to the approximate cost and help me understand the spectrum of \"template\" to \"customized template\" to \"fully custom\" it would be appreciated:\n\nHello,   \n  \nWe're a modern (healthcare business) looking for a team to help us redesign our website. You can find us at our current website (link)[.](https://empirepsych.ca/)   \n  \nAre you able to provide a quote based on the following?  \n  \n**Our Priorities**\n\n1. **Site architecture needs to be clear.** We're looking for someone SEO informed who can create a well organized structure that's friendly to both users and crawlers. Strong consideration for indexing in design, e.g. consider Java in FAQ sections, LazyLoad preventing info from appearing fast enough for crawlers to find and index it, etc  \n2. **Site performance must be high.** Design is intentional to achieve goals while not including anything unnecessary.   \n3. **UX must be strong**, with a design that presents information well and leads to conversion. Conversion is essential, pages must be designed to convert.  \n4. **Mobile optimized design**. 70% of our traffic is now from mobile, the entire site must work flawlessly, maintain great UX, and maintain strong conversion on mobile devices.   \n5. **We'd like to work with intuitive designers**. It's a bonus if we work with someone who has prior experience designing healthcare service business sites, but not mandatory. We want developers who suggest things we haven't considered. E.g. If you see several blogs on the topic of \\[topic\\], you proactively suggest creating the option to filter blogs by \\[that topic\\].  \n6. **Each of our team members is presented as an expert.** With the rising importance of authority, we want people on our site to see each of our providers as an expert. Personal profiles are well done, training and education emphasized, social proof is used, photos and videos featured, socials are featured and linked, any high domain authority links are considered.   \n7. **Design is user friendly and easy to update**. I must be able to duplicate page templates and fill in content to generate new pages, or add blog posts. \"Easy to update\" in this case means no coding is required. \n\n**Scope of Work**  \n**We need the following pages:**\n\n1. Home\n2. About Us\n3. Team\n4. Blog\n5. Contact Us\n\n**We need the following page templates:**  \n  \nWe would like the following templates, which our team of licensed medical professionals will populate with content and an expert voice. \n\n1.  Blog Post (*Must be a sharp design to build trust. Unstyled article templates look basic and spammy, we want something on brand that's custom designed, and all we need to do to create new posts is tweak H1s, pictures, video, etc.*)  \n2. Services Page (*A service page template would mean a page describing our services that we can clone and enter new information and media into. E.g. \"Service 1\"  page can be cloned and edited with \"Service 2\" info or \"Service 3\" info*)  \n3. Concerns Page (*Similar to above, but for concerns. E.g. \"Health Issue\" can be cloned and edited to cover \"Health Issue 2\" or \"Health Issue 3\"*)  \n4. Treatment Types (*Similar to above, but for treatment types. E.g. \"Treatment Method 1\" or \"Treatment Method 2\"*)  \n5. Team Member Profiles (*One of the most frequented pages. Must cover basics of what populations they work with, a bit about them, what ages they see, what their expertise is, and so on. Presentation wise think less stuffy law firm bios and more well known doctor/author/speaker bios*)  \n\n**Example Sites**  \n  \n(5 example sites from our industry)\n\nPlease let me know the next steps from here. \n\nThanks in advance,",

    "chunk_text": "Introducing new Announcements APIs Hi devs,\n\nWe’ll be adding a new set of endpoints to our Data API for reading Reddit Announcements. These new APIs are available for you to integrate with starting today, and will start returning data in 90 days. We will share more details about this change and the exact timing in a subsequent update. \n\n**What are Reddit announcements**\n\nAnnouncements are non-repliable Reddit-official messages that are currently sent as private messages. This includes:\n\n* Updates about Reddit policies and settings\n* Communications about account and content status\n* Marketing updates about products or events\n\nThe announcement APIs can be used to receive and read notifications sent from Reddit. \n\n**How announcements work**\n\nAnnouncements will appear as notifications in the notifications section of the inbox (i.e. the bell icon) on the native Reddit apps. When selected, these messages will be expandable to view in their entirety. \n\n**Why are we making this change?**\n\nWe want to make it easier for users to distinguish between non-repliable messages and official updates they receive from Reddit, from repliable messages they receive from other users, subreddits, and bots on the platform. \n\n**Migrating your apps**\n\nDevelopers should update their integrations within 90 days. If changes aren’t made within this time frame, nothing will break, but your app will not receive Reddit announcements and may miss critical communications. Announcements API documentation can be found below. \n\n**Documentation**\n\nScope required: `announcements`\n\nGET **/api/announcements/v1**\n\n**→ /api/announcements/v1/unread**\n\nFetch announcements from Reddit.\n\n|after|(beta) fullname of an announcement, prefixed ann\\_|\n|:-|:-|\n|before|(beta) fullname of an announcement, prefixed ann\\_|\n|limit|an integer between 1 and 100|\n\nPOST **/api/announcements/v1/hide**\n\nAccepts a list of announcement fullnames (ann\\_) and marks them hidden if they belong to the authenticated user\n\n|ids|(beta) comma separated list of announcement fullnames, prefixed ann\\_|\n|:-|:-|\n\n\nPOST **/api/announcements/v1/read**\n\nAccepts a list of announcement fullnames (ann\\_) and marks them hidden if they belong to the authenticated user\n\n|ids|(beta) comma separated list of announcement fullnames, prefixed ann\\_(beta) comma separated list of announcement fullnames, prefixed ann\\_|\n|:-|:-|\n\n\nPOST **/api/announcements/v1/read\\_all**\n\nMarks all unread announcements as read for the authenticated user\n\n***To test these endpoints, please*** [***fill out this form with your username***](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQQeiHvfiSV7xZwnueIIeMF5A_nIY1jdUS1ZbAR5Z-RX8SlQ/viewform?usp=header) ***so we can enroll you in the testing period.***",

A domain/keyword to ban, an improvement to the bot, or anything? Just leave a comment below or PM me [(click HERE to PM me)](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=firemylasers)!**\n\nOkay, time for a little update. I'm not that interested in this project these days, and I'm too busy with university to care about tech news. I have done nothing to the bot in quite some time beyond a minor filter list update. For the time being, this will probably continue. (The source code is also a bit hard to understand at this point, it's not the most elegantly written bot and I threw together features and patches a bit haphazardly). If you have a proposed feature addition, have noticed a problem (such as the bot stopping posting), or want me to blacklist another keyword/domain, please PM me. I'll keep this bot/subreddit active indefinitely, the VPS it's on is needed for other stuff and the bot is completely automatic (it also hasn't broken in quite some time), but I won't be actively improving it. I'm not sure how many people actually find this to be a useful alternative to /r/technology, but based on voting patterns, traffic, and subreddit subscriptions, it does seem that there are at least some people out there who find it useful, so I won't be shutting this down or anything. Just be aware that I am not currently working on this project and if there's an issue you will need to bring it to my attention for it to get fixed.\n\nAnother little update (2/5/2015): I'm even more busy with university these days. I've updated the submission stats below (close to 72k URLs submitted in the past year and a half!). The bot seems to be running fine with zero monitoring, and subreddit traffic has held fairly steady every month since the last big drop around July 2014. The log file is a bit massive, but I've got plenty of spare disk space. I still have no plans to update the bot, and while I'm not quite happy with the current filters, I don't think there are any obvious improvements that I could make. The traffic counts seem to indicate that this subreddit is still useful, which is excellent. If anyone has any ideas for keywords to block/restrict (or domains), feel free to PM me.\n\n##News\n\n[News prior to 4/29/14 can be found in the old version of this thread (click here to view it).](http://www.reddit.com/r/realtech/comments/1kjduq/subreddit_news_proposed_domainkeyword_bans/)\n\n* On July 29th, the bot was down for around eight hours due to what seems to be an unannounced change in reddit's API. I didn't notice the issue until the bot had been down for six hours, and it took me quite a while to figure out exactly what the issue was and how to fix it. Anyways, the bot is back up now, sorry about that.\n\n* It looks like the content in both /r/technology and /r/realtech has been going downhill recently. I've tweaked the filters a bit, which should hopefully improve things.\n\n##Rough development ideas\n\n* Tweak the flood limit to eliminate post flooding after bot downtime.\n\n* Consider a tag system. I could either tag with the original usernames, or with a bot-guessed topic.\n\n##Stats\n\n*Last updated 04/09/15*\n\nTotal unique URLs submitted: 80743\n\nTop 20 domains (with submission counts):\n\n    2850 arstechnica.com\n    2805 www.theverge.com\n    2479 techcrunch.com\n    1778 www.engadget.com\n    1675 www.wired.com\n    1293 www.theguardian.com\n    1212 www.nytimes.com\n    1153 www.bbc.co.uk\n    1140 www.businessinsider.com\n     963 mashable.com\n     898 www.washingtonpost.com\n     858 www.reuters.com\n     817 www.cnet.com\n     816 www.zdnet.com\n     795 www.forbes.com\n     759 gigaom.com\n     703 www.bbc.com\n     703 phys.org\n     700 thenextweb.com\n     633 www.techdirt.com\n\n\n##Information\n\nAladdin was written in Ruby.

Having an assistant that can read your documents, understand them, AND modify them based on conversation is wild.\nAnyone else experimenting with MCP? What local tools are you connecting to Claude?",

Hey everyone,\n\nBeen building side projects with coding agents lately, and while frontend development has gotten ridiculously smooth, backend stuff is still... tedious.\n\n**Example:** Just finished a stock news sentiment analysis app. The AI absolutely crushed the frontend - built beautiful charts, news feeds, filtering systems, everything responsive and polished.\n\nBut then came the backend nightmare. Sure, the AI could help design the SQL schema when I told it exactly what I needed - \"create tables for stocks, news articles, sentiment scores with these specific relationships.\" But every time I wanted to add a feature like user watchlists, I had to walk it through the entire process: \"update the user table, create a watchlist table, add the foreign keys, write the migration script, update the RLS policies...\" Then go over the migration process.\n\nThe edge functions were even worse - news scraping pipeline, LLM sentiment analysis, data aggregation. Sure, the AI could write individual functions, but they kept breaking in production. I'd spend hours digging through logs, debugging why the cron job failed or why sentiment scores weren't updating, then manually deploying fixes.\n\nEventually got everything working, but the whole time I'm thinking - why can't I just tell my coding agent \"add email alerts for watchlists\" and have it handle the schema changes, function updates, and deployment automatically?\n\n**My half-baked idea:** What if there was a BaaS designed so the AI actually understands your backend architecture? Instead of blind CLI calls, the AI has full context of your data relationships, security rules, and business logic.\n\nI'm still figuring out if this idea actually makes sense or if I'm just overthinking my own problems.\n\n**Questions for you:**\n\n* Do you also find yourself manually fixing things when AI-generated backends break?\n* What's your current workflow when AI hits backend complexity?\n\nWould love to chat with folks who've had similar experiences to see if this resonates or if there are other pain points I'm missing!",

This capability is currently available in several competing tools including Roo, Cline, Windsurf, and Trae, while notably absent from both Copilot and Cursor.\n\n**Feature Overview:** Plan Mode would provide users with a structured planning interface that allows for comprehensive project breakdown and task orchestration before execution begins which should be also linked together from the planning mode through ask or agent mode to be able to execute based on the plan or ask some questions regarding the plan\n\n**Rationale:** While it's possible to achieve similar results by instructing the model to \"plan this task\" before switching to agent mode, a dedicated Plan Mode offers several advantages:\n\n* **Improved User Experience**: Provides a clear separation between planning and execution phases\n* **Enhanced Visibility**: Offers better tracking and modification of planned steps\n* **Workflow Optimization**: Enables users to review and adjust plans before committing to execution\n* **Feature Parity**: Brings us in line with industry standards set by competing tools\n\n**Implementation Consideration:** This feature would complement existing agent capabilities, providing users with an additional workflow option for complex, multi-step development tasks.\n\nWould appreciate having it in cursor.

This was my 6 professional move and was the worst move with the most problems of all of them.  I think a big part of what went wrong was my own complacency.  My last 2 moves were with Allied, the one before that United, and then I had 2 that I honestly can't remember which company.  But all of them were very good...and easy.   I think that because my previous moves have been relatively good that I was lulled into a false sense of security and assumed as long as I was using a carrier and not a broker this one would be fine.  Since I had never used this company before I should have done more due diligence.   I wanted to share the things that I could have done better to maybe prevent some of this.\n\nI hope this helps someone.\n\n* First and foremost for me....ask questions about exactly what the claim process is and how your things are valued.  If your leather sofa gets damaged do they replace it, or repair it?  Do they depreciate it?  how is the value determined?  And if there is a value per pound...run away.  You definitely do not want to find that your $4,000 treadmill that is damaged only has a claim value of $120 because the value limit is 60 cents a pound and it weighs 200 pounds.\n   * If your move value is not the same as your homeowners goods value ask a lot of questions.\n   * How long do you have to file claims?\n   * What is the claim process?\n   * For me, I am looking for them to repair furniture.  I prefer that over payment.  Scratches happen, a professional restoration company can fix it so you will never tell.  This is the best situation IMO.\n   * If you do not have replacement value, make sure you know what the up charge will be.  And make sure you read the valuation in the contract.....don't just take the salesman's word that you can file a claim if items are damage.  Understand what the dollar value of that claim is.\n      * Caveat...of 6 moves, I have had 0 claims on 3.  And the other 3 were very minimal.  However,  there are lots of horror stories out there\n* Ask for your move coordinator's cell phone.  If they will not give it to you, ask how to get in touch on weekends and nights.  This for me is a red flag.  When the movers are scheduled to arrive on a Sunday and don't show I want to know exactly how to get in touch with someone.  I would also test this out to ensure you can get in touch.\n* Ask what happens if your things will not fit on the truck.  You don't want to be a day before closing and find out they didn't pack it right or underestimated and it will take a week to get another truck scheduled.\n   * Make sure you understand the scope of your move.  Are they moving a certain weight?  a certain volume, or everything you own no matter what it takes?\n* Ask if the crew goes with the truck or if local crews are used.  I have seen it done both ways and it was great having the same guys that loaded unload 1400 miles away.  That was in 2018 and 2020 so not sure if that is still a thing, but sure was nice when I had that.\n* If they are using local crews ask them who the company that is doing the loading and unloading is, have they worked with them before and have they ever had a problem with them?\n   * Ask them what happens if the loaders or unloaders don't show.  Is there a back up plan?  If so what is it.  Trust me when I say if you have a 27,000 pound move and the unloaders do not show you and your driver are going to have a very, very long and unpleasant day.\n      * I would also be very clear on what happens in a similar case in terms of hours of unloading.  Will they do a 14 hour day or will they stretch to two days?\n* Make sure you understand exactly what the loading and unloading windows are.  If they give you a loading date of the 11th and 12th, will it happen on those dates? or is there leeway.\n   * I would also understand very clearly how many days for packing, loading and unloading.  If they tell you it is 4 days, will it be 4 days?  Or could it be two days with a bigger crew?\n      * This is a personal preference.  The advantage to doing it in two days is less disruption in your life.  The disadvantage is that IMO it's hard to do it right with a lot of people in a short time.\n* Ask exactly how they inventory your items.  Is every item and box tagged and logged?  Again, this is a very, very important item to ensure you get your things.  I would make sure this is spelled out in the contract.  If your move coordinator tells you that is how it is done make sure that your contract says that and you don't have a driver showing up asking you to sign an inventory before it is loaded.\n* Also ask how they pack, and what the course of action is if you feel they are not packing things correctly\n   * It isn't that movers want to damage your things.  But time is money.  When I was in college I worked at a certain package delivery company that uses brown trucks.  My first day loading I was trying to load packages following this end up markings etc.  The center manager told me to ignore those markings, that it was cheaper to pay claims than to slow down.  This has always stuck with me and I believe applies to moving.\n      * I have found that having snacks and drinks ready when the movers arrive, bringing in lunch and generally treating them with respect goes a long way to their cooperation with you and you can ask them for special treatment packing certain things.  But what happens when they don't schedule enough time?\n* I take the things I know I would like first out of the truck to start using (e.g. coffee maker) and put them in one area and ask them to pack together and hold back if you can.  Marking those boxes with masking tape also makes it easy to identify on the unload end....see a box with blue painters tape on it....grab that because it has important things.  It helps get to some normalcy on the other end without having to empty a ton of boxes.\n* On third party services make sure you ask what happens if there is a problem, and who is responsible for the quote.  In other words, if your moving company arranges crating or disassembly of equipment and the bid is wrong, are you responsible, or are they?  Again, you don't want to pay up front for a service that your mover arranged and quoted, only to have the third party ask you for an additional $1300 on the spot or leaving. And if this does happen you want to make sure you are not responsible, that the mover is.\n   * If you are responsible, then I would confirm the quote with the third party company to ensure 100% the scope they were asked to quote is correct.\n   * Ask your mover what happens if the third party leaves without completing their task due to a quote issue.\n   * This is an item I would be really hesitant to let a mover quote virtually.  Or get it guaranteed. Crating is expensive so its important the sizes are right.\n* Be very clear on every line item on the quote whether it is firm or estimated.  The worst thing that happens is when the movers show up they try to up charge for any of the already priced items.\n* The best helpful hint of all is that after all the paper work is done, how you treat the people doing the work is a very key item.  Treat them well and they will make little exceptions for you that matter.",
